If you're looking to grab a little extra love for a friend or family member, definitely pick up a bouquet of their fresh cut flowers (when available). I recently gifted a bouquet to my mother in law and we both marveled over the variety of sophisticate and whimsy blooms."

Anyway, we bought some beef bone broth, peppermint handmade soap, local salad greens, 2 chocolate muffins, and their soup and sandwich lunch special which was a ham and cheese grilled cheese and butternut squash soup. My 3 year old said she really loved the lunch, and I loved it too. It tasted homemade and fresh. I will definitely be back again! It gave me the farmer's market feeling, and I am so excited about their convenient location. Can't wait to see what their lunch is tomorrow! Thanks, Oh My Chives!"

My favorite is the daily lunch sandwich.\n\nAngela posts her daily sandwich/soup combo on Facebook/Insta and serves it until 2pm. She also makes smoothies and hot drinks which I've not tried, but the sandwiches are insane. Thus far, I've tried the turkey with cranberry sauce and the turkey and avocado. Both were amazing! \n\nI highly recommend running by OMCs to pick up speciality and healthy grocery items and grabbing a sandwich while you're at it. Bonus: the bakery items are also pretty tasty and she often has gluten free and vegan options."

There is a counter to order food, a small market area, an espresso bar (Cornell Brothers) and now a juice/smoothie bar (Lokales). My veggie sandwich was made fresh to order and was reasonably priced and delicious (the honey drizzle was the perfect addition to the classic veggie sandwich) and the market has some unique/high-quality items like spices from SpiceWalla (hooray for not having to pay for shipping of spices I already love!)

However, go through the drive thru, expect mediocre to crappy customer service. \nSometimes their drive thru is jam packed with cars, and the line hardly ever moves. That is particularly annoying, since my experience in a fast food environment dictates that each customer should be served in 45 seconds or less. \nI do enjoy having their free Wi-Fi in the restaurant and access to their unlimited soda fountain to feed my diet mountain dew addiction, but this restaurant doesn't warrant a 5 star. If they can get their drive thru working more smoothly, maybe my reviews will be more stellar."

I've never tried the bubble tea, but I haven't heard great things. \n\nThe chicken, on the other hand, IMPECCABLE. We ordered out last time and got the spicy, the honey garlic, and the original. All of them were delicious, but i'd say the spicy one was my favorite. \n\nThe only minor issue I had was that the radishes on the side tasted really old, but again, not a huge issue. \n\nI will say that if in terms of pricing, they are well worth it.

These wings are hefty, delicious, and will fill you up fast - so they definitely are priced a bit above regular American wings."

We thought they were also \"one\" chili pepper rating, but looking again that is only for the wings. Flavor was decent, we like spicy wings and since it was more sweet than spice it didn't fit our taste.\n\nCustomer service was ok, not overly friendly but fast.

If you don't, learn about it!\n\nIn short, Korean fried chicken is all about the sweet-heat in the sauce.  The spiciness comes from the peppers and the garlic, and the variety of sauces basically comes down to a different balance between the two.   Pro tip: make sure you have gum or mints on you (or better yet, Listerine strips...wait...do they still sell these?) because that garlic-y spice can really linger.   Otherwise, enjoy the deliciousness as long as you like.\n\nIf you don't feel like getting your hands dirty, go the sandwich route!  They are super generous with the sauce, but the crunchiness still holds up.  You can feel, taste, and even hear each bite.  The cut of chicken itself is surprisingly large for a sandwich; winner winner chicken dinner.  Order it with sweet potato fries, and then thank me later.\n\nAnother pro tip: Since everything is made to order, it could take a while sometimes.  If you can't really afford sitting and waiting, the easy workaround is to order over the phone and then pick it up when it's ready."

It is a smoking bar, so the smell did hit us pretty hard in the beginning. We were in on a Monday night, so it was pretty slow, but service was not too slow and we were waited on pretty quickly.\n\nWe each got an order of wings, and were told that we could continue to order more until we were full. We got the honey hot and the mild buffalo wings, and waited about 10-15 minutes for the order to come out.\n\nNow, I've had my fair share of wings around area, so it definitely came as a surprise when the wings from this small local bar were unbelievably tasty. The honey hot was glazed in an amazing layer of sweet honey with a hint of hot sauce underneath, and the mild buffalo had this touch of buttery taste and did not reek of vinegar or hit so hard that you have to take a step back before the next bite. We got 2 or 3 more orders of wings, and were pretty satisfied with our order, from the delicious, plump, and crispy wings to the crunchy celery and creamy blue cheese.\n\nFor the two of us, it came out to be about $30, which was not a bad deal at all. \n\nOur waitress was a very sweet woman that made sure that we had everything we needed and was very attentive. The atmosphere was different from what I've experienced before, but with people singing in the background and just enjoying conversations with friends, I could not have asked for anywhere better to enjoy some pub wings.\n\nIt's a local pub. I got what a local pub could offer, and could not ask for more. I'm sold!"

It is nothing fancy but we go for the food so the standard accommodation doesn't really matter. The chef even kindly gave us a complimentary seafood appetizer to try, which was delicious! Our waitress was kind and attentive. We had a coupon for our check, but we made sure we gave 30% on tips. Overall, if you want affordable, quality prime rib dinner, this is the place to go.

What a fun concept --- love the idea of creating your own Korean rice bowl!\n\nOrdering online was quick and easy. You can choose a base of brown rice, white rice, or mixed greens --- BF and I both ordered brown rice, and neither of us could resist flavorful Bulgogi beef. From there, you can add up to 5 toppings for free, and unlimited toppings for an additional charge. We both added an assortment of veggies, but definitely do not skip out on the Bop Sauce for a pop of flavor and spice! We had to drive home 40 min before eating, but the bowls seemed to travel well and warmed up easily. \n\nWe also tried the Korean Popcorn Chicken, which was delicious --- flavorful and perfectly crispy. We did warm it back up in the air fryer to avoid making it soggy, and it was delightful. The Vegetable Dumplings were just okay for me, but admittedly, they may have been better fresh. \n\nI appreciated that they used a lot of paper-based takeout containers --- yay for protecting our environment! They also seem to be following COVID precautions appropriately.\n\nWish we lived closer, but would absolutely go again if we are in the area!"

I didn't get to try the food because they didn't have much left and when I asked about an item, they peeked inside several steam table pots and told me what they had remaining.

Whether you're looking for something to add to your go-to rotation or just looking for a nice take-out meal, you should definitely check this place out. Believe it one of those \"ghost kitchens\" that is operating out of Poke Ono.\n\nTheir bowls are great and filling. You should definitely try the different protein and toping options until you find your favorite. For me, I think the bulgogi and spicy pork are the best. Not saying this is the best bulgogi, but for fast casual food it does a great job. Also recommend adding the kimchi and Bop sauce (gochujang).\n\nThe Korean Popcorn Chicken is really addicting and always hits the spot. They're nice a big pieces that keep their crunch even with the gochujang-like sauce on them. The mandoo dumplings have a nice crispy outside. The vegetable ones are just OK but I enjoyed the chicken ones more."

Out of no where they called me back (didn't have my name or anything  just hit redial) to let me know they weren't able to remove the item so couldn't go back online but would open it up very briefly just for me to order since they told me they were going to open and wanted to know which platform I was trying to order on.

Nothing subliminal or fishy with that marketing campaign Subway.\nThis place was clean, friendly and if you're up for $5 sub because there really isn't a whole lot of other choices. I recommend you stop by here and you'll be greeted by friendly faces. On a side note I think the sandwiches are closer to 11.5 inches inches. I measured using a less than scientific method. I'm almost positive it's less than 12 inches. Although it could also be because I'm half Asian and maybe that could explain the difference of 1/2 inches. \nThis Subway gets 3.5 stars.

Now, rather than just Flying Fish and a few can options, the beer selection is huge with both local breweries and larger more generic beers. This new beer menu far outweighs the previous menu both in price and selection. \n\nThe food was never an issue (at least for me). Yes, they could have a few more healthy options, but for both brunch and dinner I have yet to have a bad meal. My wife and I went for brunch on Sunday (and although we were the only customers in there around noon), we had great service, friendly wait staff and enjoyable conversation.

No AC/ no ceiling fans  blowing. I decided to wait it out and eat my food in the car but after ordering 2 lobster plates with crab rice, broccoli, and corn at 2:59 pm and not getting the food until 3:55, I was too tired and hungry to wait so decided to eat there. By this time the crowd had left so it wasn't as hot as before. I had a sprite and large pineapple lemonade on the order. The sprite was room temp so I asked for a cup of ice that I never received. I went back three times for the ice and my pineapple lemonade. Each time the young later at the register assured me it was coming. Needless to say I finished my food and no ice and no lemonade ever came. I asked for a refund of the lemonade and the young later and a gentleman that I presume to be the owner just gave me my $4.00 without an explanation of why I never received the lemonade or ice for that matter. If they were out of ice and pineapple lemonade they should have just communicated that at some point and gave me the option of another drink. Now on to the food, it was ok. Nothing spectacular. The lobster tail was real meaty. It could've had more seasoning. The crab rice was just okay as well. The corn was seasoned well. I was unable to eat the broccoli because it was too soggy. Ticket was $63 but sad to say it wasn't worth it. I suggest anyone trying it out to place an order over the phone. That might be a better experience."

Minor thing but for a small establishment that's really making moves in the city I'd suggest keeping the restaurant to top notch quality. They also got my fianc\u00e9e's order incorrect. We ordered a grilled shrimp salad and they gave her a fried salmon salad. I mean technically, she ended up getting a deal I guess because the salmon costs more than the shrimp but she was really looking forward to the shrimp salad. I got the main entree of my choice of protein (I chose fried salmon), side dish (I chose crawfish Mac and cheese) and vegetables (I got a double serving of corn). It was amazing. The crawfish Mac and cheese is elite and the fried salmon was outstanding. They advertise lobster as an option for the entree but ran out when we got there. I will say the menu is a bit confusing because they don't show the entree special on their main menu and they do have it on their magic marker board menu but they don't classify the price nor the price differential in protein (for instance, the fried catfish entree special is much cheaper than the lobster entree special). Having that classified would be helpful. The place is popular and rightfully so, so the order area can fill up pretty quick. There's a big dining area but I believe it was closed off when we went. I will definitely come back for the food as it is top tier. Support black businesses!"

I ordered a Red Beans and rice, with a side of corn, and a fillet of Catfish. The Red Beans were cooked to perfection with big chunks of smoke sausage, creamy and seasoned very well. The Catfish was seasoned and fried crispy. The corn was buttery and tasty. My mom ordered a side of Regular wings. Remind you the wings come in different flavors. And she ordered a side of French fries and a couple of drinks to wash it down. Hands down it was the best damn Red Beans I've had in a long time. I ate it all. The host that greeted us and took our order was absolutely attentive and very professional. He made us feel important, and Kept us updated on the process of our order. He was wonderful. We really enjoyed the atmosphere, the customer service and definitely the food. We will be back again."

I was impressed with how the restaurant seems to be running so smoothly after only recently opening even amidst a pandemic. Kudos to management for a well trained staff. From the hostess to the bartenders, bus boy, food runner and servers...every single person we interacted with was helpful, cordial and efficient. Even though the hostess was extremely busy(Saturday night rush), she was professional and kind to us and every person I observed. We sat near the hostess stand and were greeted quickly by a server who brought us drinks and chips/salsa so fast. The wait appeared to be pretty long so I periodically checked inside and finally lucked out with two seats open at the bar. A server, Allycia, noticed I needed to get my husbands attention from outside (I didn't have my phone) and she actually retrieved him and our drinks/chips/salsa from our outside seats. She wasn't even our server and I didn't even ask for help, she just took action which ended up helping me to save the bar seats and get off the wait list for a table. Next, the bartenders...these three were margarita making machines. Quickly helping bar guests while keeping up with the restaurant demands as well. The guy bartender was the most efficient bartender I've ever witnessed and his drinks were ON POINT! I feel bad I can't remember his name.\nThe food was YUMMY! We loved the chicken empanadas, crunchy on the outside, softer on the inside with a yummy sauce on the side. The enchiladas were good. Not my absolute fave ever but still noteworthy due to the broiled cheese and portion size. I think more enchilada sauce and using corn tortillas would have been more to my liking. My husbands quesadillas were right on point and also another great portion. All in all, a great addition to the Palm Harbor area. Please keep up the amazing work!\nSome things to note: \n1. EVERY staff member was respectfully wearing a mask. \n2. The bar area can be a bit loud but what do ya expect on a Saturday night.  \n3. You can(and should) call ahead to be added to the wait list. \n4. The hostess stand seems a bit chaotic, would probably make more sense to move it further out from the entrance/exit."

My husband politely asked her to put her mask on.

When she walked away, she made a point of bringing it back down.\n\nWe immediately left, my husband called the manager who was respectful and agreed with our position, but why in the middle of a pandemic with cases back on the rise is the mask ordinance not being enforced? We went elsewhere and did not have a problem. Will not go back."

We had already ordered guacamole and the Caribbean salsa/jalape\u00f1o crema again fresh AF  like delicious  \n\nAnd then my entree came out the two to tango shredded beef enchiladas my brother pounded them down even though he was stuffed I on the other hand saved them for later (they were still great reheated via microwave). \n\nBut honestly the food and ambiance didn't compare to the waitresses demeanor Cappy, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu choices.

Adding salsa didn't help. She also got a House Margarita. Her immediate comment; They forgot the Tequila. It was large, but lacked any punch.\n     My Gringo tacos were fine.  Spiced right.

Everything was okay-- nothing outstanding but nothing bad either.  One of us had tacos, one had enchiladas and one had a burrito.

We had a pretty wide range of dishes to get the true experience and I can't say we loved any of it. Nothing had much flavor at all and everything needed a healthy amount of salt. \n\nWe started with the queso fundido which you think would be packed with flavor but somehow was not at all and the warm tortillas they were served with were just gross - wet, starchy and flavorless. We used the chips instead but the queso was still lacking. They we shared the Green Monterrey Enchiladas and a steak and chicken Cantina Bowl. The rice served with both was flavorless and clumpy. The meat was dry and all around everything needed so much salt, like someone forgot to salt anything that day. \n\nOur teas to drink were also really bad, nearly un-drinkable. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is most people come here to drink?

Came out via food runner so it arrived quickly and wasn't affected by service levels (see below).\n\nCons: Smaller space so often a wait. Not much outdoor space although it looks like they added tables in the dark alley space on the side? Service was poor all three times we were there. The one server we had walked past us inside and out ten times without looking over, as if intentionally trying not to be available, after our food came out but we didn't have silverware. It was really weird. Something was missing on an order and it was twenty minutes until we could literally shout to grab his attention as he walked past. I don't know where he was going, maybe back and forth to thirsty marlin (same owners)? That night the busser dropped an overloaded tray of dirty dishes and a bunch shattered and a table next to it got dirty food on them and shattered glass that no one attempted to clean up for like twenty minutes. Accidents happen but clean up the broken glass. Another time we went and such poor service that the manager comped out drinks. \n\nWhat we've learned to do in order to go there: order a pitcher of margaritas and your food asap since you likely won't see a server again for 45 minutes. Runners will bring food out so server absence won't be as big an issue."

How much could it be? The answer was TWENTY DOLLARS!!! Yeah, the $16 order of 4 STREET tacos (VERY tiny amount of meat) ended up costing $36 for 4 street tacos. Unbelievable that an \"up charge\" is more than the cost of the taco itself, 125% of the cost of the taco to be exact; it more than doubled the cost of the plate. We asked to speak to the manager who was annoyed by our question and did not take the charge off the bill but did begrudgingly agreed to only charge us a ten dollar up charge. Still WAY too much.

There is another turnover type dish called gozleme that can be prepared with meat or potato or feta or mozzarella cheese or a combination of the four which I have ordered to go. The lentil soup came with toasted bread and I lingered over it blissfully with Turkish tea in a beautiful glass with a tiny spoon. The lamejun came with a small salad. They also have a counter with rice puddings and other treats. This is a nice little spot and the cooks/waitstaff were busy with walk-ins and take-out orders. I hope they increase their offerings. I don't live nearby but they might be able to compete with Star Manti (in the same strip mall) which has become very expensive."

I had high hopes that this was going to taste like everything Italian Chicken dish should take like: soft & bold flavor in the sauce, lightly saut\u00e9ed vegetables, thin slices of juicy chicken on a bed of thin airy noodles. No, it was the opposite. The sauce tasted like hot water with old chicken juice. The chicken was rubbery and had absolutely no flavor. The vegetables were not saut\u00e9ed together and looked like they were out of a can, especially the mushrooms. The noodles were dense and sticky.

I also got a side of the spicy roasted red pepper sauce, and yeah I could eat a bucket of that. \n\nThe second time I went I got the spanakopita, falafel, and a \"side\" of gyro which was huge. AGAIN, OMG!!! I eat Mediterranean/ Greek/ Middle Eastern all the time and love it from everywhere (except Hallal Guys, good riddance) and the spanakopita and falafel here were the best I've ever had, hands down. Thank you to whoever decided New Orleans needed one of these restaurants in our life because we most certainly did. \n\nAnd it is an affordable CBD meal, too! I am just blown away, I didn't expect it to be great, and I've never been so happily surprised. If you work downtown, you must try it.

Over the Summer there was a \"war\" between restaurants on who had the best fried chicken sandwich and I ate my way through the city to seek out the best and THIS is it. Popeyes is a close second but umm the restaurant that is known for selling fried CHICKEN has sold out indefinitely of fried chicken. If that isn't irony, I don't know what is. I also had the Chick fil A spicy chicken sandwich, as well as Company Burger, Blue Oaks Tues chicken sandwich, Freret Beer Room's version and the fried chicken sliders at District Donuts. They were all good, but pale in comparison to Southern's.\nAnyway, so Southern's is a pop up and is a challenge to get to but it is totally worth it. Recently they won Best Use of Fried Chicken at the 2019 Fried Chicken Fest, so I am hoping to see alot more of them around now. They usually pop up on Thursdays and Saturdays at Festivals, Food and Arts Markets and at Second Line Brew in City Park. I tried their Nashville style sandwich at the Palmer Arts Market. They sell three different levels of heat: The regular which is the Lionel Richie; the spicy, known as the Otis Redding; and super freakin' hot known as the Rick James. I have had both the regular and the spicy and really liked them both but preferred the spice of the Otis one. I think the spices and the batter is what does it for me. \n\nI took my first bite of this sandwich and did not even get any chicken, that is how thick the batter is on this sandwich. I took a second bite and had their juicy perfectly seasoned chicken and before I knew, I inhaled the whole thing. I almost bought a second one but decided to save room for dessert around the corner at Insomnia Cookie. I recently sought them out again at the Freret Street Market and I ordered 4 sandwiches for my family and everyone raved about it. They thought it came from Willie Mae's. I said this chicken is way better than Willie Mae's. \n\nThe batter is thick, the bun is grilled slightly to give it a smoked and crisp flavor, the sauce ties it all together, but spices they use to create this absolutely perfect fried chicken sandwich is why it is THE BEST fried chicken sandwich in nola."

But they don't stop there - Anthony, Gene and the crew are constantly coming out with new and innovative dishes as specials to accompany their staple sandwiches - adobo cracklins, Phuket fish, the Sweet Prince, the Seoul Sister oysters, and the latest and greatest, their seasonal meat pies - Southerns never fails to impress with their knowledge of how to blend american traditional with just a hint of Asian fusion, and I'm looking forward to many years of exciting new dishes from them.\n     Besides the terrific food, the Southerns staff are incredibly warm and friendly and really care about the product they're putting out as well as the community they serve.  They're really involved with doing co-ops with other small businesses as a way of cross promotion to help bring all their products into the light.\n     So if you want a sandwich that will literally change your life like it did mine, I strongly suggest you look up and follow Southerns - you will never be disappointed!"

Since that time they have grown from a tent with a frier to a full food truck but unfortunately with that growth the quality has gone down. Going from a huge chicken breast that was three times larger than the bun to a puny cheap chicken thigh that barely seen from the bun was troubling. Latest sandwich after I took a break from them no longer even had the spicy flavors like they were once famous for. Its amazing how places change when they become popular. $12 with tax and tip for a small chicken thigh sandwich is pretty much the end for me. Ill go back to the Popeyes line."

The flavor is incredible and reminds me of my fav Vietnamese dish. 22$ is def worth it for those crawdads. The chicken sandwich also sent me over the moon.

So that was a drag. We ordered chicken sandwiches. Both were really greasy and even though we ordered mild - they were very spicy. I don't dig on spice so mild is how I always go and this was hot. That being said, I understand that heat is relative and I guess I should have ordered the \"no seasoning\" at all. That doesn't make up for the incredible amount of grease. In the end, four of us had sandwiches and four of us got sick - vomiting sick. I gave 'em two stars for the cracklins but those were just okay. Maybe it was an off night for the sandwiches.

The reviews were GREAT, that's the only reason I tried them. \n\nSalmon - dry and tasteless. I'm not sure what they're seasoning their food with, but it's not not style. \n\nBrussels Sprouts- tasteless again and hard, but it leaves a spicy after taste. \n\nBBQ RIBS & Wings - The ribs fell off the bones, however the taste was of pepper and more pepper,  I thought it was the sauce so I rinsed them off and it still had that gross pepper taste. Even my eyes started to water. \n\nMac & cheese was pretty tasty per my son \n\nPotato salad was DELICIOUS, my FAVORITE!! \n\nBaked beans were EXCELLENT ALSO. Finally a sweet flavor that wasn't spicy and it felt like the beans melted in your mouth, they were so GOOOOD. \n\nI wanted to like this place, but oh well \u200d. \n\nThe two stars are for the potato salad and the baked beans, everything else was a disappointment. \n\nMaybe you guys should do a smoked sweet flavor. But to have it smoked AND peppery was not cool, I choked...BUT that's just me \u200d"

Visiting from VA and although we have been dining out and ordering delivery almost every night, we find ourselves constantly chasing that food high ...you know, that food that makes you dance while you chew.

The baked beans were a perfect compliment and the Mac-n-cheese had a buttery yummy taste.

I got the salmon salad and the lemon pepper wings n fries combo. The salmon was smoked/baked to perfection, with a great seasoning base, with the skin side left on and crisp, all the flavorful fats have fully cooked so the flesh slides off easily if that skin is not your thing. Salad is as pictured: cherry tomatoes, a single boiled egg split in two, shredded mild cheddar, slices baby cucumbers and small croutons. Shredded romaine. The lemon pepper wings were delicious, smoked to a crispy perfection, and the seasoning blend has a sweet note that pairs well with what tasted like applewood smoke so you're having the smoked and seasoned skin crunching into a juicy lemon peppery chicken wing, it was just right. The wings are so good I can't remember how many pieces there were, maybe 6-8? The fries are McDonald shaped, seasoned with Cajun seasoning/Tony's. All in all a good experience. If you decide to pick up, you just park on the street, residential neighborhood, there's a small sign on the mailbox which I didn't see at first, the driveway may or may not have a car parked but the waist high iron gate has a white doorbell button that I didn't need because the family has a set up mother in law suite looks like attached to a longer garage/smokehouse, anyway they can see you clearly if you're standing, everyone was wearing protective gear and their face mask (which just recently was no longer mandated so I wouldn't trip, just wear your own) and asked who you were picking up for. The receipt says prepaid or not so no funny business. I think if you order over the phone by calling in they keep the need for giving change to a minimum, so come with easy cash to minimize friction. I'm definitely going back and spreading the word. This is the wave of the future for those with an entrepreneurial spirit!"

Basically, the dogs are wrapped in bacon and then there are several toppings that make them even more unique. \n\nI cannot remember how much they cost.

If I remember correctly, it was a little over $14 for the 2 hot dogs and one coke.\n\nAmy (I am assuming was the one serving us) was wonderful! Really nice and great customer service.

They've been selling these hotdogs for 12 years now and it's always the two of them working. You can tell that they actually enjoy doing this by the satisfaction they get when they know their customers leave happy. \n\nTheir hours are Thursday-Sunday 6pm-9:30pm and they are parked right outside Big O Tires on Pyramid Way. \n\nHighly recommend trying these out for yourself!"

Luckily I live in an area that is abundant when it comes to filling those soft pretzel cravings and even though I much prefer the salty and savory treats, the warm cinnamon and sugar dusted pretzels are a nice reward, especially when spread with cream cheese.\n \nThe soft pretzel has come a long way, some saying the Mayflower actually brought over the recipe, wouldn't the pilgrims be surprised to watch us dunk our pretzels in cheese sauce or lather them with mustard, although who knows, maybe they spread them with something even better, like a goose, duck or whitefish pate' or wrapped in bacon. hmmm...\n \nWhat I know they didn't have, for sure were hot dogs, sausages and cheesesteaks wrapped in soft pretzel dough! They also did not have men selling dusty cold salted soft pretzels from the medial strip of a busy eight lane highway, which I was foolish enough to do when we first moved to the burbs of Philly. There are way too many locations around now with hot ovens and pretzels in many shapes and sizes, some coated in garlic, I'll bet that would be good dipped in butter.\n \nBut they also didn't have world peace during the early 17th century.

                "text": "Token Ramen & Tea (Kung Fu Tea) opened two days ago at The Shops at Wiregrass!\n\nThey are located right in the main entrance between Grillsmith and Cantina Laredo. The interior is nicely decorated with ample amount of seating on the inside and they have four tables on the patio for outside dining.\n\nWe got our food to go:\n- Ninja Chicken Nuggets\n- Takoyaki\n- Black Garlic Ramen\n- Mega Pork Ramen\n- Honey Oolong Tea with Boba\n- Passionfruit Green Tea with Boba\n\nOverall the food is really good even with just take out instead of dine in. We are glad that their food and drinks are consistent with other Token Ramen locations!\n\nThe Mega Pork Ramen was really good: the broth is super milky but a tiny bit salty in my opinion. However, you can taste the different flavors of the pork chashu slices from the Pulled Pork Chashu and the Mega Pork Chashu. The eggs are perfectly seasoned as well. \n\nThe broth in the Black Garlic Ramen is definitely smells garlicky and looks on point, but I expected more of the black garlic taste in the ramen. It is still good overall but I had high expectations lol\n\nI'm going to get a little technical with drinks because I have a family member who works at KFT in SoFlo:\n\nThe drinks are made perfectly just we ordered:\n- Honey Oolong Tea with no milk, no ice, boba, and 100% sugar \n- Passionfruit Green Tea with no ice, boba, 30% sugar (less sweet)\n\nThe two girls at the front making the bobas were very consistent and well versed in their orders: they poured all of the drinks over ice first before capping them off. Overall I am super appreciative of the bobaristas because not every place gets our order correctly and usually leaves something out. \n\nHere are a couple of tips to keep in mind before you visit:\n\n- You will need to fight the mall parking because they are inside wiregrass. So be prepared to drive around to find parking!\n\n- They just opened two days ago (on Friday) so  they are very overwhelmed in the kitchen so BE PREPARED to wait for your food! \nThe drinks are not an issue and come out within 5-8 minutes max, but the food took over 40 min for it to come out. You will need to order first before you can sit down at a table so the cashier will tell you that the food will take about 40min wait. The service is super nice and friendly and they are very apologetic about the delay.\n\n- You might be able to order ahead (if you are lucky) because they are super busy and sometimes they don't pick up the phones. We tried calling them a few times and we decided to just head over there and order in person instead.\n\nOverall we are super glad that this place opened up and now we get our boba within 5 min from our house! We will definitely return again for the food in a few weeks when they have adjusted to their routines."

But I like my Caramel Macchiato Slush better. Rich in flavor. \n\nOur appetizers is the ninja nuggets. This Taiwanese street food is delicious. My wife have Mega Pork Ramen. There are charshu pork and charshu pulled pork. This may be the best value. The broth is pork bone base. I have the grilled shrimp ramen. It come with 8 pieces pan seared grilled shrimp. Both our broth is added black garlic. Extra $1 for black garlic to be added. \n\nFood is great. Measure the price to value and quantity is 4 stars."

The team really is BOMB! The first sip I was like wow...so much flavor and so refreshing. \n\nI've eaten twice at Token Ramen...each time, I kind of had some after effects that happened...but if in a pinch and I really want some Ramen...I know I have something that is decent nearby that I can go to and just be prepared to use the restroom after."

I tipped, which turned out to not phase those girls in the slightest towards giving us any service. We sat.  Our appetizers came out. She gave us no napkins or silverware, or side plates to eat off of. One of our appetizers never even came to the table. After our ramen was delivered I returned to the counter to say we don't need the other appetizers that didn't come. She didn't offer me a refund. The shrimp in my ramen was very over cooked.

However, to put something positive, the taste of their spicy ramen broth was delicious and brought back nostalgic memories for me (Oakland/SF kid).

His help appeared to have sped things up. \n\nI must say, while we are an part Asian family who have dined in many Asian joints across the US; this place is really really good!

Alas, I was to be disappointed. To say they were overcooked would be polite. To say they tasted like licking an ashtray would be an understatement. A more appropriate analogy would be that they tasted something like eating your last meal as a pyroclastic flow raged down Mt. Vesuvius right as the sulfuric cloud envelopes Pompeii. \n\nThe service was also exceptionally poor. They were having issues with their card reader, and they asked to re-run my card. I pulled up my bank account on my phone and showed them the charge was already pending. They still said the needed to run it again. Naturally, I ended up with two charges on my account. I spoke with the manager, who was gloriously incompetent, and proved to be no help whatsoever.\n\nThe one bright side: the margaritas are pretty good.

Getting our drink order, getting the drinks, getting chips and salsa, getting more chips and salsa because we were staving, getting the food.\n\nBut again, the chicken fajitas were so very good!\n\nWhile we were there they seated a large party right next to our table.  So close in fact if I wanted to I could have reached out my arm and rested my hand on their back.  It made me super uncomfortable in the time of COVID, but luckily we were almost done with our meal and we could rush out."

I've been to restaurants where they give you tap water, but this water had such an odd and unpleasant taste.\n\nThe restaurant isn't the cleanest or the most pleasant setting.\n\nOverall the food was well cooked, but the flavors were horribly executed.

Other than the brick behind the bar the walls don't really belong in a sports bar and have a lot of empty blank spaces that could be put to better use with decor. Feels like the owner or owners aren't really fans of sports and didn't know how to style their bar accordingly.\n\nWhile we do live in Florida we do have chilly days and nights in the winter months. If you come during one of these days be sure to bring a jacket as having the heat on doesn't seem to be a concern to the employees. Several people around the bar mentioned the cold of the restaurant and the bartender turned the temp up a bit, but it was still cold.\n\nAll in all a good local place to go with good food and a friendly staff."

I ordered the baked chicken shawarma entree which consists of a generously sized chicken breast and two sides. By Abe's recommendation I went with mashed potatos and maple glazed carrots. The chicken breast was surprisingly juicy and flavorful - I say this as someone who is consistently disappointed by chicken unless I am having the fattier parts like wings, drums, or thighs. I actually ordered the shawarma out of reflex, not realizing it was a chicken breast (no I didn't read the description on the menu) so for a brief moment I was petrified when I saw a chicken breast on my plate (yes I hate chicken breasts that much). Since they marinate the chicken breast, I was pleased upon first bite and quickly finished it. I usually don't eat carrots but these were good. The sweetness of the maple really brought out the flavor of the carrots. I loved the mashed potatos - they were perfectly garlicky. \n\nThe honey roasted brussel sprouts were a love affair - I try to eat these things at home but can't get them to taste good without drowning them. These brussel sprouts tasted sweet and a little spicy - they  had an Asian fusion influence I wouldn't have expected from a Middle Eastern restaurant - but doesn't that make this even more interesting? I am a huge sucker for honey, garlic, and sesame seeds. I wasn't disappointed.\n\nFinally, let's talk about their fruit compotes.

I've been following Indy Dough for months on social media and have been anxiously awaiting an opportunity to try her donuts that everyone raves about. This morning I tried the apple fritter and vegan-ish old fashioned donut with chocolate frosting and sprinkles. I also got a vanilla iced chai. The apple fritter was still warm and melted in my mouth. Perfection. I saved a few bites for my husband and he thought it was delicious! We split the old fashioned and both loved it. We're both not huge donut people but couldn't get enough. The iced vanilla chia was also perfection. Great flavor. Cannot wait to try more of Amanda's creations in the future!"

It's mostly donuts but ever once in a while you will get graced with a perfectly chewy cookie, a delectable galette, a scone, or slice of cake perhaps - but it's all glorious - all delectable.   I will warn you - once you go Indy Dough... you'll never go back!\n\nSo the owner, Amanda, is literally the sweetest and one of the most humbly talented pastry chefs I've EVER met.  Her pop-ups are insane they sell pur in less than a minute - if you miss it that's the game baby, try again later.  You've been warned they literally sell out online in less than one minute everytime and normal in store pop ups in less than 30 min (and those start at 6am).\n\nI can't pick a favorite - it'd be like picking a favorite child.  However I will say...\n\nHer french cruelers are something like I've never tasted before - they're light and airy and moist and crisp and adorned with delicious flavors like cardamon or coconut hibiscus.\n\nHer Old Fashioned donuts are similar to a cake (if I have to compare them to something) but their also not comparable to any other cake donut you've ever had.  \n\nHer yeast are o so delicious, but appear in rare form as they take a lot more work and space to prep than any others.\n\nThe Fritters, if the heavens shine down on you and you are lucky enough to get your hands on one of Amanda's Apple Fritters... crisp edges, chewy insides, loaded with cinnamony apples, a sticky glaze, and flaky salt.  They're perfection.\n\nChocolate Chip Salted cookie, they're that perfect chewy cookie with melty chocolate chips and flaky salt on top and I highly recommend devouring them immediately or topping with some ice cream.\n\nSo if you want a bite of heaven follow @indydough on insta (it's the only way to know) and set your notifications and all your reminders, and maybe say a little good grace!"

They were sadly out of most pastries, but we ended up with a galette-like tomato + cheese tart. It was so damn drool-worthy. \n\nIt had a variety of colors of tomatoes. It was perfectly creamy from the cheesiness and salty from the buttery pastry. Can't wait to try more of their stuff and hope to see them do more pop ups downtown!"

This pop-up happens in Studio C, a creative culinary wonderland that consists of private chef dinners, single daily meal specials, morning coffee and this sweet pop-up. \n\nWhen Amanda took to creating these artisan donuts, the city immediately flocked. Follow her on Instagram (@indydough) to see the different baked goods she cooks up each week. She usually makes donuts: think everything from cherry vanilla crullers to guava cream cheese old fashioned and black sesame glazed donuts. They're truly cooler than any donuts you've ever tried. \n\nI saw a post about white cheddar, green onion scones and immediately hopped on it. I messaged Amanda the night before the pop-up and she set one aside, as they usually sell out. This is the kind of place that you will have to arrive incredibly early to even have a chance at scoring a donut. There's a limited amount and they sell out in person within 30 minutes. They'll be a line outside before the place even opens. Go to bed early, get up early, and be ready to wait for the experience!\n\nThank you Amanda! I gobbled up the scone so quickly and it was so, so, so GOOD."

They are seriously so so good and feel more elevated than your average donut because they are small-batch and are made with really unique flavors like guava cream cheese. I went to the pop up at Studio C a few weeks ago, but you'll have to follow along on Instagram @indydough to find out where she will be next! When I arrived 15 minutes before opening, there were already a few people lining up outside so definitely arrive early. I got a donut, a buttermilk biscuit with jam, and an iced chai latte and everything was divine. \n\nStudio C is right on the Monon, so if you're out for a run and think to yourself \"I'd rather be enjoying coffee and a donut\" then stop here!"

I can't begin to say enough about how amazing the baked goods she puts forth are. \nWhile her focus is doughnuts, there is opportunity to snag cookies, fritters, scones, and even more! She does brioche, old-fashion, and cruelller donuts but it'll depend on what is made as options are typically limited. \nShe was based out of Studio C but now will do pop-ups with other local businesses which is always a plus for me. If you want to find the next pop-up, follow the Instagram account to keep up to date. When a pop-up does occur, you will need to get there at least 15-20 minutes early (I would suggest 30 minutes to be safe) or have a timer ready to order a ticket for an event.  The price is a bit more than a standard doughnut but it is totally worth the cost in my opinion. \nHer apple fritters are one of the best I've had and actually what got me to try them with her balance of sweetness, apple chunks, and salt it really does hit the spot."

Today I tried all four flavors she offered {I brought a teammate because it's a 2 doughnut limit}. The apple fritters are so delicious and have just the right amount of sweetness. The crueler was light, warm, and covered in a delicious sugar blend. The banana doughnut was covered in a tasty glaze and freeze dried bananas for a unique and tasty flavor combo.

For starters, Indy hasn't had much to offer in terms of breakfast tacos or burritos over the year so I was giddy to hear of Brookside Burrito coming on the scene from a friend. Who doesn't love a grab and go, affordable weekday breakfast option?\n\nBefore I dig into the food, I want to talk about the mission behind Brookside Burrito (one of the coolest parts about it, in my opinion). Brookside Burrito provide jobs and critical on-the-job training to those most at risk. In their words, \"Every item on our menu tells the story of our streets, hand crafted by the folks who call these streets home. With every satisfied customer, we are reweaving the fabric of our community and helping at-risk individuals rewrite their own personal narrative. Together, we're highlighting the value that Brookside brings to the near Eastside of Indianapolis and showing that we are more than the stereotypes, labels, and statistics suggest.\" A lovesong not only for the community of the Near Eastside but its people. \n\nFor those who live downtown, this is less than a 10 minute drive! The online ordering process is seamless too. The night before our porch breakfast, I placed the order (all burritos are $3), and scheduled my pickup for 7:30AM. I pulled up to the church where the kitchen is located, called the number and within a few minutes my bag of hot burrito goodness was back on the road. I have to say, this is a great offering for catered work breakfasts, etc. \n\nWe ordered a variety of burritos - vegetarian, the One and Onley (named after the street and filled with egg, potato, meat, cheese), and a few others. All were great and held their heat really well.\n\nCan't wait for our next visit and for more folks to discover this Near Eastside treasure."

I like mine with tons of stuff in them and multiple flavors so I loved the Tuxedo. \n\nNext time I'll definitely have them delivered (only $3) since they had gotten a large order and I had to wait longer than I had planned to for them to bring them out to my car.

We also got a loaf of the French batard which was also decent. Very crusty which is always a nice feature on fresh bread. Looking forward to try other menu items but would probably skip the bagels."

The dark chocolate together with the doughy bread and dried cherries was yummy with my morning tea. It could use more cherries though.  Of course we had to buy the pretzel shortbread Such a unique flavor combo.  \nThe staff person was so friendly and answered all our questions plus gave some info about the company.  \nThere is a glass jar with small biscuits on the counter. When I asked about buying, the cashier said they were complimentary with coffee. I'll give you some to try!  She gave us a handful.

Not chunk or cubed ahi that is customarily sold in Hawaii but ground. The flavor came mostly from the unagi sauce and some sriracha but that ground up fish did not go well and was totally unexpected leaving me very disappointed. \n\nI would suggest using chunked or cubed ahi for the poke to get it closer to original poke if you want to call it \"Hawaiian\".

At the end of the event, there was a lot of food left over that we asked for them to package for us, and instead, the servers packaged it up and took it home for themselves. When I called Marti Weber, the Catering Sales Director to discuss it, she was rude, curt and hung up on me. This company does NOT know customer service and has very poor follow through."

I ordered poached eggs easy, hash browns, sausage and toasted English muffins. My reality was, poached eggs medium, country potatoes, bacon and floppy semi warm English muffins. There were only two customers in there so I'm going to blame the head cook on this one. There just isn't an excuse for this kind of mistake. I saw the ticket and it was ordered proper.

In July new management moved in and began what appeared to be a remodel with a new business coming soon.  Soon after the Prodigy Burger & Bar sign showed up with opening coming in September.  It opened about two weeks ago.  We decided to give it a try tonight.  It was disappointing from the moment we walked in and realized the furniture was the same table  and chairs as the previous owners.  The walls had been painted and redone.  The TV's and furniture are old worn and outdated, cleanliness was fair at best.  Service was OK team wasn't well trained which was obvious as time moved on.  The adult drinks ordered were weak, the Pepsis were under calibrated and tasted like soda water.  My fries were warm and my wife's were cold.  I ordered a double burger that was not well done it was burnt and crusty and the portion size for the cost wasn't acceptable.  It reminded me of the WENDY'S commercial years ago 'WERE'S THE BEEF\" all in all it became comical my wife looked at me smiled and said we tried it this is the first and last time and I had to agree.  We spend $56 plus tip I can say it was worth about $6.  Sorry but I not only can't recommend Prodigy and will not go back to give them a second chance.

Great burgers in a few different styles, like smash burgers (thin patties), a beef blend thicker patty and Wagyu burgers.  With so many to choose from, it was hard to make a decision but hubby opted for a Macafee smash burger - two patties, bacon and Mac n cheese on his burger.  He said it was very, very good.  It could have been better seasoned but a nice compliment of flavors and very craveable.  For just an extra dollar, you can get the duck fat fries so he got those with his burger.  I have never had Wagyu beef so this was my chance.  I ordered The 16th Masterpiece which had saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and two cheeses.  It was EXCELLENT!  Again, could have been better seasoned but did not detract from the meal.  I ordered the regular French fries and there was a different between the duck fat fries and regular.  Both quite good so having both was a treat.  I normally barely finish half a burger but this one was so good I ate the entire thing.  There are several other interesting things on the menu so even if you aren't in the mood for a burger, you can find something appealing.  I definitely want to try several more menu items so will be back!  I highly recommend them and a great neighborhood eatery!"

We ordered 2 apps, fried pickles & breadsticks. The breadsticks were fairly good & the mariana for them tasted like it was house made & pretty good. She came back & got our order after a while. As we sat waiting for our order, multiple servers continued coming to our table with other peoples food. We waited about 45 min or so for our food order & during this time, our server couldn't keep up with our drinks at all. We were having to tell the servers that were bringing us other peoples food that we needed drinks. \nOur order finally arrived, but not everyone's at once. Some had to wait another 5 min. Now the menu states the burger are cooked to order. We were never asked, at all. Pretty much each one of our burgers came or we added a special sauce to it. None of them came with it, we had to ask when someone who worked there was around. Also, during this time we dealt with a numerous amount of gnats & flies around us for the rest of dinner. \nOne of us in our party had asked for teriyaki sauce on the burger, it wasn't on there, but they did bring it when we asked for it. Its not teriyaki, its bbq sauce. Another in our party ordered the jack Daniel's whiskey sauce, again, not on the burger, had to ask for it. Its not a sauce, its pretty much a straight shot of Jack Daniel's, its terrible. I ordered the duck fat pomme frites, they were soaked & sitting in a huge grease pool, I couldn't even eat them at all. Their filet tip mac & cheese is very dry & the meal taste like it cane from a box out of the frozen aisle at Wal-Mart.  After we were just over it because of how bad things were going with everything. We paid & left. \n   Going back to they just opened not long ago, staff was terrible & didnt seem trained well at all. The flies/gnats were ridiculous & it didn't seem very clean in the dining rooms at all from the ceiling to the floor. I think they need to close down & complete more training & cleaning & look over their menu & get rid of things because it seems as too much & they can't keep up. They also need to go over their menu/recipes on everything & adjust them. Teriyaki & bbq is not the same. Jack Daniel's whiskey sauce shouldn't be straight jack. \nWe, the entire party of 6, will not be back. Awful"

Manager on duty brought second sandwich that was cooked medium rare but she ordered well done.  By the time they brought her third sandwich everyone else in the party was done eating. When she received her bill it was full price. We didn't expect to get anything for free but we did expect the manager to acknowledge their mistakes. The manager came to the table after our server got him and he was not a pleasant person. My friend told him what happened and he said \"I know\". She told him she was surprised that he didn't offer any kind of apology...no verbal, no discount, no offer of a dessert, nothing at all...to our complete shock his response... and I quote... \"you ate the food so why do you expect anything? If I ordered and ate it I would pay full price no matter what happened.  If you feel like you deserve a discount I'm sorry.\" \nThe manager on duty was John. We let him know that we would never be back to this restaurant again and he said \"okay, I don't care\" and walked away.  I think my statement of being shocked was an understatement. We go to dinner as a group every Thursday and this had been one of our stops every 2 or three weeks. Our combined totals, for the entire party, usually top $200 or more but apparently this restaurant group is doing so well that they don't need our business. We will definitely never return. Another person in our party was given the wrong sandwich as well."

We asked and the waitress stated they were all out of blueberry's and that the blueberries get stuck to the ice and don't add any flavor so it's no big deal- we were completely shocked by her response! \n\nWe then order our dinner; we ordered the fried green tomatoes, the Prodigy burger and the cobb salad.  I asked if I could have pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar cheese; the waitress said I could not alter the burger in anyway then I asked if I could have some extra pickles and she said she would have to check. \n\nWe received our dinner and noticed there were no extra pickles and she said they don't have any extra to give out only what come with the burger. Then during this same time the table across from us was asking their waitress about their seasonal salad for it did not have any pecans, strawberries or apple slices on it and the waitress told them they were out of those items too. \n\nI asked to speak with the manage; after approx. 15 mins he come out and said is there a problem....why would you not tell someone that you do not have all the ingredients to make that item(s). I asked for the hard blueberry lemonade to be removed for the bill and he stated no. I then explained to him our experience and he said \"you don't have to come back it you don't want too\"- seriously!  The manager ended up giving us $1.00 off our bill. \n\nWe eat out once a week typically on Friday evenings and we understand that the eating out experience is much different than pre covid; However, this was a horrific experience!!!"

Plenty of parking out front during lunch.\n\nThere were just a few minor issues that kept this from being better rating.  My wife and I ordered non-Alcoholic milk shakes and though the taste on each was delicious, the shakes were very thin, almost milk like.  I like my shake to be cold and more than chocolate milk in consistency.  We both noticed and I don't think that it had to do with it being a warm day on the patio.  We drank them fast.  The straws they provide are standard skinny straws so if you order a shake that has any cookie crumbs or fruit, you may have trouble getting those.  We asked for spoons to grab those bits.  Maybe they should look into getting boba straws while making the shakes thicker.  Skinny straws would be really tough to use if the shakes get thicker.\n\nI broke one of my own rules by ordering seafood at a place that specializes in burgers.  I had one of their signature burgers at the Carmel Prodigy, so I decided to try the Teryaki Salmon just because it sounded good.  I devoured it and it was cooked perfectly.  Remained light and flaky and the sauce was tangy.  The steamed broccoli was a little bland (kind of expected), but some lemon pepper would go a long way to making it more tasty.\nMy wife ordered the Hoosier Daddy Tenderloin and like most places, the meat greatly exceeded the bun size making it necessary to cut the tenderloin and stack it to get any condiments and topping with the meat.  Much of the meat was cooked okay, but parts were really dry and tough to cut through with the table knife.  The breading was okay, but could have used more seasoning as well.  just a bit bland.  The house chips were crisp and crunchy, but the oil had a slight burned taste even though none of the chips were burned.    Everything was fine to eat, but no wow factor.  The Asian slaw that also came with my meal could have used just a bit of sweetness to offset the vinegary taste.  \n  The restaurant looked very nice and clean and the patio is smartly styled with fresh flowers and plenty of umbrellas for the tables.  This place has a wide variety of foods available including cocktails and some craft beer (provided mainly by BrewLink).  I will gladly return to try some other items.  Good service throughout the meal.  Review #3937"

When we started ordering he demanded to see id's before we could look at the menu.

Upon entering we found it to busy and s bit loud, but were greeted promptly and led to our friends. The interior is nothing special and has several dark rooms with TVs, so I might suggest an overhaul of the decor but if you think sports bar then you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe waitress was prompt and friendly and had good suggestions. She was fast given the rush of people which we appreciated.\n\nWe ordered the fried pickled pears which were delicious! Think coney dog batter and crispness with a tender pickle inside. I loved them! Plus you got 5 spears which is plenty for sharing it almost a full meal. The sauce that came with it was also ideal as it had some spice but the creaminess of it tempered the fried crisp of the pickles.\n\nWe all got sandwiches or burgers and everyone seemed pleased. I had a veggie sandwich which was good. I liked the Asian slaw aspect which made it seem fresh and light. It came with house chips which my husband loved and thus ate. I actually preferred his fries which were perfection. Either way they had plenty of side choices fir s small upcharge.\n\nI got a fresh cider which was delicious, and I always appreciate a place that has not just canned ciders.\n\nOur friends had an adult milkshake as dessert and said they would go back for that again.\n\nIt was a great tasty spot for a night out, keeping in mind it is rather loud with the TVs so definitely not conducive for much conversation. But a fun spot.\n\nOne note though is that the floors were absolutely disgustingly dirty. As soon as we walked in both my husband and I were worried as if the floors are an indication of the overall cleanliness what might the kitchen look like? So note to managers, maybe beef up your cleaning and a more regular vacuuming is definitely needed. Or ask in Robert Irvine to change it all out for you so you can't see the dirt?"

They must have knocked down walls because it wasn't this big. We started with Breaded Cheese and Fried Green Tomatoes. The cheese was good, bit too much breading and I bet they are frozen not fresh breaded. The fried green tomatoes weren't green and were cut too thick making them sorta soft inside, but they had a lighter breading. Had they been half the the thickness they would have been better. I make awesome fried green tomatoes. I got the Ultimate Bacon Cheese Burger. Only complaint the bacon needed to be crisp. It was pretty stretchy. But the burger was good and cooked right and the fries were good. Husband got American Smash Burger he said it was good. He ate every bite and the Tots were good. He also got a Chocolate Madness Shake. I thought it was pretty chocolatey he said it could have been more chocolate, but he's a chocoholic. One friend got the Hoosier Daddy Tenderloin. I didn't much care for the texture but she liked it and it was her sandwich. She got a side of house made chips and they were pretty good. Other friend got BYOB I don't remember what she got but she also ate it all. God Son got the Mac N Cheese Smash. It was super messy. It kept sliding all over the bun but he loved it. He also got a Cookies and Cream Shake. I would like to try the Carmel location to see how they differ in food and service. Our server was a bit rushed and got a little snappy at one point.

When she received her bill it was full price. We didn't expect to get anything for free but we did expect the manager to acknowledge their mistakes. The manager came to the table after our server got him and he was not a pleasant person. My friend told him what happened and he said \"I know\". She told him she was surprised that he didn't offer any kind of apology...no verbal, no discount, no offer of a dessert, nothing at all...to our complete shock his response... and I quote... \"you ate the food so why do you expect anything? If I ordered and ate it I would pay full price no matter what happened.  If you feel like you deserve a discount I'm sorry.\" \nThe manager on duty was John. We let him know that we would never be back to this restaurant again and he said \"okay, I don't care\" and walked away.  I think my statement of being shocked was an understatement. We go to dinner as a group every Thursday and this had been one of our stops every 2 or three weeks. Our combined totals, for the entire party, usually top $200 or more but apparently this restaurant group is doing so well that they don't need our business. We will definitely never return.

The ribs were undercooked, not raw by any means, but undercooked that the ribs took a lot of effort to eat. Cutting the ribs almost broke the plastic knife. The ribs was cold and then reheated on the grill top which lead to a rib that was too hot to handle in certain areas and too cold in others. So context for this place, it's a cool place to grab  bite while you're drinking at the Boxyard, but definitely not a BBQ joint to be a destination."

We would go inside; eat breadsticks and salad bar why we waited for our pizza.  We would play songs on the jukebox and of course play PAC-MAN. Those were the good old days.  At least now we can still enjoy the same pizza at home.  \nThanks Pizza Hut for being prompt, polite and above all hot, fresh, delicious pizza."

I overhead the owner/manager stating that they did not like Hispanic/Latinos people working or dining at the restaurant.  I felt deeply disgusted, outraged, and offended by such heinous comments.  New Orleans is a city that embraces a diverse and rich Spanish, Latin, creole, and African American culture. To have a business owner/management express such ignorant and inhumane views is unacceptable.  If you care about equality and respect for all human beings, do not eat at this restaurant.

So we finally got the burger and asked what happened,why wouldnt ANYONE tell us that it would take time to get that burger.  Anyways, burger was hard and definitely not tasty..its unfortunately that we wasted out time AND money ... \nIf you can avoid eating there, you better do so. \nI think the manager of the store needs to educate young people at Burher King about simple etiquette and benefits of providing positive customer service.."

It only got 4 stars because their hours are awful (8-3) and their exteriors lacks a call to action- there's nothing from the outside that pulls you in. \n\nIMO, it should be open earlier to catch the morning crowd heading to work (have you seen how busy Starbucks is at 7a.m.?)- many mornings I'd love a delicious croissant but they're not open. Not to mention getting a dessert to take home after work or a coffee and sweet treat after dinner or movies- you can't- they're closed. \n\n I passed by for a long time before stopping in because I didn't have a need for cakes or cookies. But this is far from a typical American bakery. Looking at the bakery from the front, you'd never know it's a European bakery. There's just a black awning that says \"Riverfront Bakery\", no personality to it. You have to go straight up to the window and peer in to have any idea what deliciousness lies within. They have an assortment of goodies that include freshly made crepes, quiche, scones, croissants and so much more!\n\nI tried the chicken salad and it was very fresh but sadly lacked any flavor. It tasted like chicken & mayonnaise and that's it. However, everything else that I've tried is wonderful.\n\nThey have a small sign across the street from Starbucks that tells more about the place than looking at it from the outside. The folks that own it aren't very friendly or personable either, but their treats make up for it. If you can catch the place open, it's worth stopping in."

In any case, I did try Riverfront's plain and chocolate croissants to see if they come close.   Sad to say, they don't.  Yes they are airy but I would not call them flaky.   The dough itself is very eggy and almost has the texture of a popover.  However, I also got the chouquette and this was a very tasty pastry with a cream that was not quite whipped cream nor patisserie cream but something in between.   I would order this again.   So this gets a 5, the croissants a 3. Overall, food 4 stars.\n\nI can see where parking might be challenging here but I was lucky to get a spot out front."

They offer a few tables along one wall and have set up a couple of outdoor tables to be more COVID-friendly. All staff were masked and sanitizer was readily available, and there is a layer of glass through which you can watch COVID-safe workers prepare more pastry. \n\nWe had a tough time choosing which pastries to try; they offer a lot of traditional French baked goods like chocolate croissants and pain aux raisins. We wound up with a plain croissant, a cheese brioche, an \"everything\" brioche (modeled after the bagel, of course!), and their croissant-donut of the day, which was pumpkin pie flavored. The croissant was excellent, with the light, flakiness you'd expect from a well-baked croissant. The brioches both had pockets of cheese and flavor in the middle, along with seasoning on top --- both were delicious, though I think BF and I agreed we preferred the Everything Brioche over the Cheese. The croissant donut was delicious --- two donut-shaped pieces of cinnamon-sugar covered flaky pastry with pumpkin spiced pastry cream between, a divine fall treat. \n\nI'm looking forward to trying more of the menu, including crepes and quiches. \n\nSide note: the quote painted above the menu speaks to Yelpers everywhere: \"There is no love sincerer than the love of food.\" Clearly, the designers of this place are my kind of people."

It has a split level plan with 3 small-group-sized private dining areas, and a main open seating area with booths. There was only one server, but he was quick, attentive, polite, and accurate. On their website they have some pics of their food. The one of the Tuna Tataki is what lured me (I'm sure it's a stock photo), but the presentation in person was even better. I started with the avocado salad, then to the Tataki, and for a main course the red curry with chicken and shrimp. All of the dishes had great presentations, were served quickly, hot, and fresh, perfect portioning, and were absolutely wonderful. The sushi chef said goodbye to every customer who departed, and seemed genuinely happy to have been able to serve. I love this place.

It was still very busy inside however. The place was packed and it was hard to see some of the vendors which made it difficult to determine if we should wait in line or not for any given booth. It was also dim inside. I was confused about why you could get free tickets ahead of time if you didn't need a ticket to get in. From an economical standpoint it would have made more sense to have free RSVP and $5 at the door or something. \n\nWe ended up walking around the area once and heading out.

I say this because I saw how much it slowed down after 3-4pm. I also noticed that food vendors had run out of food. Maybe it was because the food was just that damn good. Not sure though. I did have the gyro from Three Carrots and it was delicious! \n\nWhat a turnout! It was a bit over crowded at points and I don't think people could see which vendors were where. I thought it was a great idea how the vendor names were high above the vendor tables though. It just was hard to get to at points. It was great to see how many vegetarians and vegans are in the area though. And how many businesses are!\n\nOverall, great event. Especially for the first year! Can't wait for next year!"

The beverage stations were on opposite sides of the venue from the tables and food vendors. The flow of the raffle was odd. The venue was a bit tight and humid (the rain didn't help).

Not exactly.\n\nWe were there right at opening time of 1:00. It was raining, which normally deters otherwise hardly Hoosiers. But not today. The line wrapped around the entry space a few times then around the corner. The rent-a-sheriff wasn't letting people park in the grass lot across the street. That was all I needed to drive right on by. We did look for street parking around the block, but when we couldn't find any for 4 blocks west of the event we decided to kill time downtown and come back later.\n\nWe hit it again at 3:00 and luckily there was no line. There also was no parking. Though we could see several empty spots in the paved parking lot right behind the Biltwell, more sheriffs weren't letting anyone in--only out! The fact that we still had to walk 4 blocks in the rain just because these guys and gals wanted to trip the power fantastic, was stupid and infuriating. And they knew there were empty spots and they were just not having it. We weren't the only ones who were put out. Others were grumbling about it as we all walked in. I learned from these fellow attendees that people were getting cars stuck in mud in the grassy lot across the street earlier, but no one could figure out why the cops weren't letting us park in the actual property's own paved parking lot given all the available spots. It created a severe traffic problem in the surrounding neighborhood that I'm sure the residents didn't appreciate. \n\nIt was still pretty crowded inside half-way through the event. I can't imagine the craziness that beset the place at 1p. There were a ton of volunteers in purple Eskanazi shirts clumped up front, in a few conspicuous places near exits and main arteries, but they were seemingly not doing anything helpful. Not checking phones for tickets, not facilitating lines, not taking out trash or the like. Just standing there.\n\nThe bottom floor had clothes and beauty product vendors, holistic practitioners, and various organizations' booths. Upstairs were vegan food vendors. When we got upstairs by about 3:20, lines were still quite long and most vendors were out of at least some of their offerings. After standing in line for 25 min so my son could buy a vegan sugar cookie for $3 just to find out that the ladies at the booth were gabbing endlessly with whoever, I'd basically had about all I could take. We'd signed up for iridology readings (insert eye-roll emoji), so we did that and then were out. It was an okay event to go to once, but we won't be back next year."

At times it was hard to read signage from the amazing vendors. I really enjoyed the variety of vendors from food to hygiene.

We're all in this together and it starts with an entire community of raising awareness to make something like plant-based living become a common, socially acceptable lifestyle. \n\nI loved the variety and diversity of the groups. \n\nA few suggestions for future VegFests: \n- bigger space. Look, the space it was held in 2017 was great for a first year. They didn't expect so many people to show up so they did the best they could and honestly, it worked. \n- more food. I love me some food so even more food tables would be perfect. \n- I can't remember from 2017, but was there a nutritionist there? I'd love to have more medical professionals there (i.e. nutritionists, doctors, pharmacists) that are using more holistic approaches to their medical professions. It's hard to come by in Indy sadly. \n\nReally looking forward to this year's fest and can't wait to see an even higher attendance to support plant-based living!"

Perhaps it was an attempt to not make it too game-y with the liver and heart, but it really just tasted like mildly savory oats that were fried in casing. The chips were pretty average as well, especially for a place that has to compete with fries from other locations easily accessed within the complex. \n\nFor $15 for a handful of fries and a piece of haggis that was the size and shape of a medium-sized corn dog, I was pretty disappointed overall.

Since the Sandwich the Bartender recommended came with Pimento Cheese was ordered he came back and same no Pimento Cheese.  Really?  On a Friday?  And not like there is a Publix or Trader Joe's to buy some until your supplier delivers.  Got a different sandwich with Buffalo Sauce and blue cheese was good but wasn't that special for 9 bucks. Sandwich only.  For 9 should include a side or make the sandwich 7 and 2 for a side The place itself it really nice and clean but the for what you get food wise not worth the visit."

This should have been a clue for us, duhh! My sandwich was covered in some king of salad dressing that made it wet and it did not taste good. I only ate half of mine. My husband too only ate half of his chicken sandwich and that is unusual for his big appetite. He got the waffle fries and they need a lesson on that from you know what fil-a place. We didn't finish the waffle fries either. Just get me out of here so that I will never come back. One star for our very friendly server. Maybe the place just needs to stick to their pizza (it's actually a pizza place not a chicken place)."

They are actually part of the Tampa Pizza Company, so don't let that fool you since they are the same place. \nWhen I went online to order, it goes to the Tampa Pizze Company page on ChowNow which confused me. I did see most of the options on the menu along with Tampa Pizze Company menu items. I decided to call and order to go. When I called the nice guy who took my order explained that they had just added this new concept, so I can order online even if it shows Tampa Pizza Company. When you go their website and order online page, it'll take you there but don't be confused because it's the same owners! \n\nI know I just explained how much I love chicken tenders and I do BUT once I saw the delicious chicken sandwich options, I had to pick one of them! I went with the Chick Jagger and my boyfriend selected the Cocky Balboa! Yes, the sandwich names are awesome! They have several other choices including a grilled option and a grilled wrap. They have chicken tenders along with Mac and cheese options! Most sandwiches are $8 (grilled are $9) and you can add a side of waffle fries for $1 or regular mac and cheese for $1.50 or special mac and cheese for $2. The two special mac and cheese option are Buffalo and Truffle. Note: For some reason the Cocky Balboa doesn't show up on the online order options but it's available if you call and order. \n\n* See my pic of the menu options for descriptions of everything! Also available on their site. \n\nBoth of these sandwiches were delicious! I tasted both and would eat either one again! They were big, chicken was cooked perfect and juicy! Just the right amount of ingredients and the flavors popped! Nice portion of waffle fries for the extra dollar! We also got a large size truffle Mac to share so we could taste it. Also delicious! \nI couldn't even eat all of my meal. \n\nI wasn't at the restaurant because it was to go (they have delivery too) and my boyfriend picked it up but I'll get pictures on another visit because we will definitely be back! We started inhaling our food, so our food photos are in the moment and gritty (AKA.., partially eaten!). I'll call these artistic! \n\nYou should definitely try this new joint in South Tampa!"

Ordering was a bit of a pain because I got the processing circle that never resolved, and no confirmation email. I called the restaurant directly, and they said that they did receive the order. Then, I got an email from their online ordering service saying the food would arrive in an hour. Half an hour later, a delivery person was at my door with the food. It was too confusing, but I'll forgive it as this is a newish restaurant, and I certainly preferred that the food showed up significantly early rather than significantly late.\n\nWe tried the chicken tenders with waffle fries. The tenders were huge, half a breast of chicken each. They were juicy, but the breading wasn't crispy. I thought the fries were underseasoned."

But thats ok bc thats not your job.\nYou were supposed to bring swivel mount but we got different one and you admitted that you made a mistake and you'll bring the right one. Let me remind you that you came into the house without a mount and asked if we need one even tho we previously agreed on this. So you just forgot. Thats ok it happens. Just don't lie. Your girl then pulled out from the car the mount you had at the moment. \nNo way that we said that we hired you because you were least expensive, shame on you for saying lies like its nothing. I clearly said that you had the best reviews out of 3 people who responded and that is why we hired you. Lies, lies, lies. Now I now reviews are fake. And do you want to say how much we paid you?? Was that cheap? \nWe were away for 5 days only and when we got back we kept calling and calling and then after 20th call you said YOU were away and will call tomorrow to schedule appointment and that didn't happen. We kept calling and texting.\nOn Thumbtuck your account IS deactivated, does not exist anymore so I found you here and the communication was really miserable. You said: I'll come next week.

They have justifiably less options and it is too busy to have personable interactions with bariastas like you would at the actual roaster.

I visited for the first time on 11/12/20 and ordered a Grilled Platter. Platters come with two skewers of meat, seasoned rice, cabbage and house sauce. I wanted the beef tenderloin but they were out. I ordered one chicken thigh skewer and one pork tenderloin skewer ($13). That week, everyone who ordered a platter received a free Glazed Donut Ice Cream dessert. One of the owners heard me mention that I was bringing the food back to my office, he generously threw in two more skewers of meat for me to share with my coworkers. I and my three coworkers unanimously agreed BOM deserves a 5 star rating. I am no expert when it comes to Japanese charcoal grilled meat but the meat was high-quality, flavorful and tender. It was served on top of a generous bed of rice and cabbage with a delicious house sauce. The appetizers which consist of two meat skewers, would be perfect for those following a Keto,  Paleo or Gluten-Free diet."

A limited menu of Asian meals and snacks is also available. The price for a bubble tea is slightly lower than I have experienced in other places. My taro bubble tea tasted exactly as I wanted - sweet and milky. On another visit, I had a chocolate milkshake. The serving size was slightly smaller than I expected, but again, it was very rich. \n\nThere are a few tables in the caf\u00e9, and service is very friendly.

The pricing for drinks is $3-4 and the sizing is smaller than other places. I think that the cost ends up being comparable though. The store is small, with only a few tables. There also aren't any games like in other bubble tea shops. So I'd say grab a drink to go."

Part of our order was missing, the appetizers came to the table along with the sushi. One person ordered hot food and it was 30 minutes late to the table after the sushi was there for everyone else. I know that the manager was not having a good night but why should the whole restaurant suffer? For an 89 dollar dinner, we should have gotten better service and food. I have no idea what they're putting in the rolls now, but they are using way too much rice and not enough fish! And lettuce? In three of the rolls, they used lettuce as filler. WTF???  What am I paying for? High-priced lettuce?\n\nNope, we're done. I used to love this place, but it's gone downhill and soon will be gone. Too bad. I had high hopes. You can't expect to keep customers with bad service. There was a huge table in the center of a large family and they got all the attention of the two waitresses while everyone else was almost ignored. Who do you think is going to give better tips? People with a lot of kids or four guys who are out on the town? Why did the waitress go around and clear tables with no people, yet leave our table full of dishes and trash?

See the pic I posted. And just because it's empty, doesn't mean the waitstaff has to hover. It's highly uncomfortable. So, even as the sole customer, I felt rushed.\n\n3. There is such a thing as too much rice. There IS. See pic I posted. I'm not paying for rice, I'm paying $13 for fresh fish and flavor and whatever else you consider sushi; maybe artwork.\n\n4. I got a roll that had shrimp tempura in the center. And while the roll was very good and flavorful, you could tell that the shrimp tempura had been made earlier in the day and was now cold, and a little chewy. Obviously this ruin the flavor of the roll, It wasn't so bad that I didn't eat it, but it was definitely a little off.\n\n5. The floor was so sticky that I literally had to go into the restroom and scrub the bottom of my boots with soap and water.\n\nNow to explain why they still get 3 stars-- i'm nitpicking.

Front of house was less organized, but passable. The biggest exception being that the tables were sticky, and our table had some damage to it. There was also a poorly placed room divider that was knocked over and hit a couple of guests on the head. They appeared to be fine however. The general atmosphere of the front of house was dark and cozy, which was perfect for our mood that evening, and cold which was less welcome. Once we did get our food, we were treated to a train of all the FOH staff stopping by to see if we needed anything. I appreciate attentive service, but our drinks were full and food uneaten. No. We need to be left alone to enjoy our food. (I'm being nitpicky here. My date didn't seem to notice/mind these issues, and everyone was friendly and helpful, just super busy)\n\nWe ordered a couple basic and a couple specialty rolls. These were well presented and tasted good as they looked (5 stars, really). I'd say more but every meal consumed at this restaurant appears to be well documented on yelp already.\n\nOn the whole this tucked away little restaurant is worth stopping in on.

No, it's not the best one in the Indy area, but totally on par with other sushi places we've tried.  The pricing was very good, two adult males ate our fill for under 35 dollars. The miso soup was better than some of the higher-priced places we've tried and the sashimi pieces we had were fantastic, fresh, thick, big pieces, well worth the price. The rolls were a little loose, but still great sushi taste and lots of variety on the menu. We didn't try the teryaki food but might next time just to see what it's like. And yes, we'll be back.\n\nNegatives: The only things I'd say negative were that they need a better style of ordering sushi, as it's very difficult to keep track of what you want if you are ordering pieces at a time. Print up some cheap sushi tabs and get some pencils, problem solved. That's a standard used in most places. As well, the salad was swimming in dressing by the time I was half done, so ease up on that and perhaps throw in some arugula and romaine instead of all iceberg lettuce which is just plain wrong.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant experience and we'll definitely be back with friends."

There were a few other tables, and one server but he managed to take care of everyone fairly well. He was entertaining and funny, which was the best part of the meal.\n\nNow for the food. I ordered a spicy tuna roll. It was disappointing. They chopped up the fish into some type of puree before putting it into the roll. It was not spicy at all. I would not recommend ordering this roll. Maybe their others are better.\n\nMy mom ordered the shrimp hibachi. The shrimp were terribly overcooked and rubbery.  I had the chicken hibachi. The meat tasted had a freezer like taste to it. Both meals came with veggies and fried rice, which were pretty good. The sauce they put on the hibachi is pretty good, like a standard teriyaki. The meals came with a weird sauce they called \"yummy sauce\" and it was basically like spicy mayo. It didn't seem to belong with the meal. \n\nThe bill came to about $40 for the two of us, and the food was just not good enough to command that price. I don't plan on coming back."

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is they don't serve alcohol."

They are all feel so Americanized and cheap (cutting corners); if you like that kind, then go ahead. \n\nOwned by a Cantonese Chinese couple, they are down to earth, friendly individuals who will cook the food on the spot and deliver it to you. There's a good selection to choose from, but I would recommend the steak over rice/noodles, beef & tomato over rice/noodles, or the teriyaki chicken over rice/noodles. Ranging from $5 to as much as $8, I guarantee that you will be ridiculously full due to the ridiculously large portion. \n\nRicky Cafe is probably the best food truck on campus that can deliver awesome, filling Chinese rice and noodle dishes at a fairly good cost.

It was a good sandwich for about $3-4, which is unbeatable for the price. I agree with a previous reviewer about the coffee being hit or miss, but what do you expect from a food truck? Obviously, it's a lunch truck right on Drexel's campus, which makes it targeted towards broke college students and not for people of exquisite taste buds. Because of this, they have been in business for quite some time now and it doesn't seem like they will be leaving anytime soon. If you're hungry and need a quick and cheap meal, stop by here on your way to class!"

Of the lot of us four of us absolutely loved the Grand location, two more enjoyed it, and two more were excited to try it after hearing us talk about it.\n\nWhen we arrived at the Ladue location we should have left immediately.  It was six o'clock on a Saturday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant other than the employees, one of which was eating in the dining room.  \n\nTwo trainees were at the counter, neither of which knew the menu.  Many items that we enjoyed from the Grand location were now no longer available (the bisque, five of the six cinis, the breaded chicken) along with many of the toppings (arugula and spinach were no longer available, they ran out of pancetta and angel hair, so on).  \n\nDisappointed we placed our orders while the manager explained the Grand location is now closed for good, and explained about what happened with the owners.  As he did, the trainees wrapped up our orders without offering us toppings.  When I asked if this had changed they opened up the to go containers and we went through the process.  However, the counter had a puddle of water, which the trainees ignored, placing two of our to go boxes IN the puddle.  The manager noticed it eventually and wiped it up, but made no attempt to correct the two orders which had already been left in the water.  \n\nI wish I could say this was all that was wrong, but it isn't.  One of our party is rather cheese sensitive, but after tossing the pasta in the sauce the cook started throwing cheese onto it, and looked shocked when he asked him to stop.  They should have offered to replace the meal, but did not.  We ordered four orders of cinis, and rather than tasting fresh and fried they tasted like they were reheated and baked.  \n\nThe manager knew there had been problems and offered us free bread and cookies.  A nice gesture, but nowhere near enough.  Of the eight of us who ate that night five of us ended up having stomach issues.  After the venue change, the management and employee change, and the drastic reduction to the menu I can safely say the Ladue location is nothing like the Grand location which we loved so much.  A very disappointing end to a once lovely restaurant.  \nAvoid."

Horrible acoustics - like so many franchise/chains in strip shopping centers, you walk in and the cacophony is so annoying - the super high ceilings causes talking and music to be practically unbearable and so ANNOYING.\n\n2. The menu is confusing and convoluted. I consider myself to be a relatively intelligent individual and I found that I had to inquire what the deal is with their ordering process ... the employee in front of me told another employee to explain it to me, I got the sense he was fed up with explaining the process...ps the music and noise level was so loud I could barely hear the explanation.  \n\n3.  Cost vs. Quantity - this place is overpriced for the portions - I have had so many outstanding lunches throughout St. Louis for under $10 bucks and I can tell you that most of them, you can split or have left overs to take home.  \n\nI ordered a pick 2 -  an order of \"cini\", should be \"chintzy\" - 3 very small arancini - got the 4 cheese variety with the pomodoro sauce.  With a salad - NO grilled items (that would have tacked on even more $$) and an ice tea - $9.25.  The portions were small by any account - and I was finding myself trying to get every little scrap from the salad bowl.  It was so disappointing - the food is tasty I will give them that - but the price they want you to pay for the the quantity and the Blech atmosphere.  I'll pass !!!"

The meals are easy to heat, well portioned with dietary/nutritional info clear, and stay well throughout the week. \n\nThis has been an amazing option for our household dinners, catering to different taste preferences in our household, convenient & healthy! \n\nNow let me tell you about why would i give a 3* rating with such a fantastic product. \n\nMenu options- eh. They rotate menu items, but not enough. They have a wide variety but not a large variety of meal, but unless you have a wide palette, you don't have a lot of wiggle room. \n\nOnline menu vs what's delivered- While they offer a wide variety of options (low carb, extra protein), they don't consistently tell you what substitutions will be used. For example, the low carb steak option showed rice on the menu, I expected rice (not really thinking about the low carb part). I emailed them and was told that that because its low carb, they substituted rice for veggies. No biggie but I just expect the menu online to match what I'm ordering. Also, low carb also sometimes means cauliflower rice with almost every meal. Some of the low carb substitutions weren't bad, but green beans smothered with enchiladas were just kind of weird. \n\nInconsistent & unreliable software issues - During the holidays, we skipped a couple weeks worth of delivery. I had gone on their website & selected the option to skip deliveries. The first week skipped fine, the 2nd week- I got charged and when I emailed them, they said their systems glitched and apologized, immediately refunding my money. A couple weeks later, we were back on deliveries & we got a call that they were changing subscription platforms and advised we would need to sign up again. I went online and signed up again, selected meals for the upcoming week & thought we were good. Turns out, their new platform is not any better, as it \"forgot\" my order (despite an email confirmation) and we didnt receive our delivery. When I emailed about that, they offered to deliver some of what we ordered but said they couldn't fulfill it all. We opted to go grocery shopping. \n\nWe have recently started alternating weekly deliveries with other companies to provide some variety. I'm finding other companies have more consistency with the food substitutions & their menus match what is delivered, as well as less technological issues.  They all have their pros and cons, I will continue to alternate MPR into our routine, and confident they can rock the market with the kinks iron out."

                "text": "I cannot say enough good things about Meal Prep Reno. I'm going to tell you my favorite things\n\nFirst and foremost: the food is fantastic. They have a huge variety. There are options to fit most diets including low carb and vegetarian. I'm trying to really watch my calories and macros right now so the low carb options are mostly what I've been doing. They're so good! They use things like cauliflower rice and green beans instead of regular rice and beans, so you don't feel like you're missing out. So far my favorites are shawarma chicken, red enchiladas, and chimichurri steak. Honorable mention: chicken cacciatore with polenta. AND I AM ONLY 1.5 WEEKS IN!!! I'm so excited for all the other things I will be trying in the near future. \n\nSecond: convenience. I used to spend at least half of Sunday meal prepping for the week. Hours of being on my feet in the kitchen (instead of spending time with my family or doing fun things), and then half the time I would be sick of the meal I made by Wednesday and wind up with takeout anyway! Now my Sundays are free! They deliver to my front porch (for free) and I get to have a different, delicious, healthy meal each day. And they only take a couple of minutes in the microwave to prepare.  \n\nThird: ease of ordering and customer service. Their website is user-friendly, they have all the calories and macros listed for every meal, and it's very quick and simple to hop on and choose my meals for the week. On my first order, I accidentally selected the wrong delivery day for my orders and didn't realize til after I submitted the orders. It was easy to figure out how to change it for future orders, but I couldn't change it for the current week. I emailed them requesting a change and their reply was prompt and they fixed it for me. \n\nFourth: cost. Someone told me they thought it was kind of expensive... but when I really sat down and thought about it... no, it's not really. I thought of cost of all the ingredients I was using to make 5 of the same meals for the week, plus the cost I was incurring when I got sick of my meals halfway through the week, throwing them out, and getting takeout anyway. Plus, as they say, time is money: my Sundays are valuable to me! \n\nMeal Prep Reno is worth every cent. I look forward to every single meal, AND in just this week and a half with no takeout lunches, I've lost 5 lbs. And I got to spend my last two Sundays relaxing and enjoying my friends and family. Win-win-win."

Unfortunately we got the same meals as we had ordered the previous week because Tuesday is not stated anywhere. The food wasn't bad just bland and it was pretty big proportions, but since contacting the company and explaining the order cut-off misinformation, their response was that the Wednesday deadline is for their workers making the meals and that they recommended for the customer to make their selections by Monday even though the website states Wednesday for subscriptions. Their website should have the correct info especially since that's the main mode of communication. The whole purpose for me was to not have to eat the same thing week after week and she didn't provide great customer service for this mishap which turned me off and the meals weren't that flavorful.

Recently I ordered them to go to share with friends and they all agreed with me. Otherwise, the other food I've tried is also delicious. They have a nice lunch special at the moment, but that may change with the buffet opening soon. I can't wait to try more of their delicious dishes.

We live less than a mile from this one and gave it a shot for Friday lunch, partly because it was the closest, most convenient choice. We hoped we wouldn't be disappointed by a \"rebranding\" of the previous Indian dood at this location (which was...meh).\nThere was absolutely no need to worry! The new owners obviously are in it for the long game and know what they are doing. (Presumably, this is related to the Nirvana in Lafayette Hill? We've never been, but this place seems like the work of experienced ownership.)\nWe shared the Chicken Momo as an appetizer. These dumplings were obviously hand-made and fresh. They were delicate, and steamed perfectly. Each one held the broth from the perfectly-spiced chicken inside. They came with two spiced dipping sauces: peanut- and tomato-based\nMy dining partner ordered the day's tandoori chicken special, which they described as \"I think ... the best chicken I ever had.\" It was delicious. \nMy Nirvana Shahi Paneer was perfectly spiced and really well-balanced kind of \"stick to your ribs\" vegetarian dish. It is my new Indian cuisine fave. (I have to admit to beaming with pride when the owner said, \"A lot of Indian customers order this.\" We are obviously not Indian. )\nWe were full from our lunch and even took home leftovers, but wanted to see the menu again (it is extensive and we were already planning our next visit/take-out). Our discussion led to the waitress (also owner, I think?) bringing us a free sample of the Rasmalai. We were so glad she did. This cottage-cheese based dessert is hand-made. Meaning: the cottage cheese is made on-site, as well as the dessert. At least that's what they told us and it is believable. They're like little pillows of delicious in a milky rosewater bath with ground pistachios. \nWe will definitely come back (and order takeout from) here again."

The ice cream is homemade, as are the cookies. Even the vegan options are excellent- I would definitely recommend them even if you aren't vegan!\nIf you are thinking of hiring the Sugar Wagon for an event, I would highly recommend them.

The selection terrible, frozen meats are freezer burned, the one defrosted chicken the size of my fist was $13. \n\nThe produce is poor and a lot of the same labels as shop n save, but 2 and 3X's  more expensive.  There is nothing to choose from, the beer is 50% more, the so called prepared food is not fresh, 2 selections, poorly priced.   What's positive - there was at least 7 staff, nice to support employment and wages, unfortunately most of them are standing around since there are only 5 people shopping at 6pm on a weeknight.  Obviously, this venture is heavily subsidized and may be time will help.  \n\nTo boot - the baby formula was listed at $41 the same product through Amazon is $22.  This has to be one of the worst excuses for a food market and reminds us of Sappington Market, except they sold Xmas trees and pumpkins.   I only saw a few items 150 mile and a few 300 mile labels, do the owners think we are dumb, we can afford to live here I'm sure we are smart enough to know when businesses are trying to get over.\n\nThey should have let the furniture maker lease out the building."

Or is it something you buy now and then just to make yourself feel healthy? \n\nIf it is the former then you need some serious income to feed this habit!  I walked through this grocery store today ( formerly  McDonnell Market)  and was I UNDER-whelmed by the smell, decor, and enthusiasm of the employees. When you walk  through the door, a waif of unpleasantry doesn't set the mood for a good experience. In all fairness McDonnell's had that same odor. Local Harvest spared NO expense remodeling the place either. I would not have known it changed hands if the signage did not tell me so or until I actually investigated the contents.   I was OVER- whelmed by the sticker shock on the items. A small Cornish Game Hen $18.99 that is one hen for one person that you have to cook yourself. Do you cook Organic food in Organic seasonings? Do you make Organic sides to go with it? Every item I picked up seemed ridiculously priced. They offer a Rib- Eye Steak $19.99 that said Grass Fed. I thought all cows ate grass... am I missing something? Do I need to be Organically enlightened? \n\nThis weekend was their less than Grand Opening. They had a few people handing out samples. Well, the wine lady was sampling but it was kind of like, 'one for you one for me', OK, one more for me, it was the highlight of the visit.\n\nThis place was just a total let down from the odd smell, the jazz music playing in a 50's retro grocery store, the lack luster hospitality, to  the eye-opening sticker prices.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Urbania  can co-exsist in Suburbia."

See all the people being booted out of their houses.   Then comes wages.  And if you cannot get a distributor forget about anything being on the shelves.  Today grocery stores have the merchandise company stocking the shelves not the employees that work for the stores.  Also, way back when for every part time person you hired, the union required a full time person be hired.  Women that were married, had children were told to leave the work force (kinda like the legislatures are doing today) and no moonlighting allowed (companies wanted 100% of your energy).  So what are your representatives and companies doing for you today?   Sorry, I thought a little history of then and now might help.\n\nBottom line.  Nothing has ever been easy.  Things change because of people and I think anyone who endeavors to start a business should be congratulated not criticized.  Ask a better question, what did the place look like when they moved in and how good was the equipment.  This is a reflection on the landlord, the mayor of Kirkwood.  The lesson here is get the whole story before you make a comment.  Thank you for reading my feedback.  Remember only you can make the difference.       \n\nKay"

It looks they threw some items on the shelves, put some casual tables/chairs in the front and forgot about the rest.\nSome shelves seem a bit bare but I suppose that leans towards the knowledge that you will find something fresher than in an overly stocked grocery store  \nThe interior is NOT inviting nor does it make you want to eat there.\nI do love the deli snacks in the back. \nI will be going back to try some sandwiches and maybe a brunch.\nRight now it looks like you are eating in someone's back stockroom with less charm.\nI'm sure they will improve.

It was a cute young girl asking if the order was a phone order, she proceeded to give me the receipt to sign and told me to have a blessed day. So sweet. \n\nSmelled good. I got enough for my mother to try actually, I was excited because harolds  is in St. Louis. I opened the bag and first thought.... \"Breaded\"........ this is oddly light... whew please say this chicken is done all the way. My mother saw the light color and declined to try it I was scared because it's chicken yall. That can go wrong..  \nsecond thought, Harold ... fried hard my fried hard... you eat harolds... fried hard   salt , pepper mild sauce on the side of that thang... this can't be but let me rethink, it may be St. Louis version. I was truly afraid to try,  so there was one chicken that was a half shade darker than the others and I tried because I was going to throw away but I had to see. \nI can say the fries were good but unfortunately I'm so sorry to say that the chicken didn't have taste to it. It has a greasy taste which I didn't feel so good after but I had one and it didn't have flavor in it which I was hoping. It could possibly be the day and time I came.

I think the person taking orders was training so she did require help, but overall the ordering process was smooth.  They request that you stay in the waiting area which is quite small and kind of hot, but even that wasn't too bad.  We got our order pretty quickly (a lot faster then the Harold's back home lol).  The food was fresh and hot and I couldn't wait to dig in.  The food was delicious, BUT that was not Chicago mild sauce.  The breading on the chicken was different as well, it was more similar to Popeyes... But I actually prefer their chicken over the Harold's chicken in the chi. Everything was on point though, the sauce that they used was really good (they were a bit stingy with it though lol).  My advice is to just keep doing what you're doing, just add more sauce to the chicken and fries and fill your sauce containers.  Kudos to the owners, I hope their business prospers.

It reminded me of a London's & Son- the mild sauce was more like ketchup than mild sauce. The hot sauce, wasn't hot. The chicken was fresh but love and flavor were not presented. The chicken was lacking seasoning and there wasn't a lot of sauce. Since they've just opened, I'm willing to try it again when it's less busy, to see if the qualify of food has approved.

Greeted by friendly customer service, props for the cashier handling an extremely disgruntled customer. He assured me my order wouldn't take long, and it didn't. Very clean and orderly. This pizzeria is located in this gas stop that has my fave Itlaian ice, and has some other things I need to try like the tacos. There is indoor seating. You can call to takeout your pizza too. Not sure if there's delivery.   \n\nUnique selection of pizzas. They have other items too. My margherita pizza was made perfectly. Easy on the eyes, and balanced taste. The meat and onion pizza, can't remember the name, was just as good. I don't say this much, but I really like the crust/dough. It's tasty enough on its own. Perfectly baked and charred in all the right places. Almost smokey. \n\nPrice and portion is just right for the quality. Please keep it up, this the only pizza option around right now."

Why serve that when they can see how charred it was?  (to the point of being able to use it as a charcoal pencil)...\n\nI'm in the habit of trying places a second time before a bad review (this one is an average review)... and I'm seriously glad to see so many 5-Star reviews for this new place... giving me hope we just had a bad one-off experience.\n\nWe will try it again, because I can see the great possibilities, but will eat the pizza there (as others said the atmosphere is gas-station chic), as the pizza was indeed luke-warm when we got it home, as well...  If it's good fresh out of the oven, we'll go back to take-out and reheat when we get home.\n\nThey did add a few small slices of other pies for us to try (great idea, and good tastes) and they did add a couple of deserts which were tasty, which was nice, but we could have done without the extras and just had what we actually ordered, done right, and been happier.   \n\nWe did call them about the salad and they promised us a coupon to make up for it, but we have not gotten it... so, jury still out, and I'm still out $9.00.\n\nWe too will bring some friends as I love to support local businesses but I also don't mind giving candid feedback in hopes a better meal on my next visit."

I may have put the cart before the horse here.\n\nIt took me forever to find this, for lack of a better term, kiosk in the mall.  Not having even seen one of these world famous potato places I was not sure how this worked, let alone what the menu consisted of.  I kind of just stood there and tried to watch how things went here, but that did not lend me anything, I was still as clueless as when I finally found this kiosk.\n\nI finally went to the counter and decided to do a combo, but not a potato combo, a chicken combo.  If you are world famous for your flavored potato products, why is there chicken?  I might be focusing on the wrong thing, but that does play part in here.  I went with the tender combo.  You get three chicken tenders, a Mega size fry, and a medium drink.  The price was there, and it seemed like you got a fair amount of food for the price.\n\nSo here is when things started to go south.  I finally made it to the counter and the young lady that is working seems less than impressed to be where she was at that moment in time.  She talked in such a monotoned voice at such a low level I had to keep asking her to repeat herself.  I lost count of the times she sighed, I had no clue how the ordering process went and she just would have rather been rolling on out of there for the amount of times she rolled her eyes.  Now, I think that the employees here were fed up because they seemed to be short staffed.  Also, either the manager or owner shows up and does nothing but have a conversation on the phone and paces back and forth in such tight quarters.\n\nAnyway, I finally get my food and make my way back to where I was staying.  Get there and open up the box and think to myself this ought to be good.  Well, it wasn't.  The chicken was basically flavorless.  Which shouldn't be a surprise since this place is supposed to be world famous for their flavored fries.  I was like, OK, let me dive into them.  Well, it was a disappointment to me.  When you have your fries, you get a choice of six different flavorings that can be on your fries.  I opted for the cheddar flavoring.  Now, when they say flavoring, I assumed a coating on the fries that would shine through.  Not the fries being encased in flavor.  I mean no surface is left uncovered.  The cheddar flavoring was not all that great, in fact it reminded me of the flavoring packet from a microwaveable mac n cheese bowl.  They felt over-greasy and my fingers changed colors.  \n\nWorld famous, maybe not.  Philly famous, probably.  But definitely not the best place I have ever had a fry at."

There were plenty of people waiting for their orders of fries, tater tots, chicken tenders, and definitely no salads.\n\nI came with my coworker, and she got a combo tots and tenders because the chicken poppers advertised on the menu were not available. It came with a large drink. I went with the \"jumbo\" (small) tater tots only.\n\nThere were a lot of young kid staffers with two or three older men who just have been the managers. Because the staff were just opened an hour or so, it was not a well oiled machine and it looked like bumper cars in the small space for all of them. There also was some confusion as to which direction does the line go for ordering and pickup.\n\nThe food itself is made in some industrial stainless fryers which you just pop the product in the hopper and set a time. Then a few minutes later you're good to go. My tots were nice and crisp with no grease taste. The chili BBQ seasoning was fine. Not homemade, but good. The tots from my coworker got the cheddar seasoning and also was just fine. Her chicken tenders were crispy. They weren't great, but also not the worst she's ever had. I saw they were just regular grade tenders in a sealed plastic bag. The ranch dip was good. She was disappointed that the lemonade was just the Coke variety and not a fresh squeeze like we get at the Reading Terminal Market (see my review!). \n\nSo there are some kinks in efficiency to work on, but I'm sure in time that will work out. The food is good when you're in the mood for some comfort food. \n\nMy jumbo tots were just under $5 and the combo meal came to $11. You could probably get a better meal for that amount elsewhere, but this was nice.\n\nAbsolutely would come back for the tots."

A burger and fries were affordable and tasty.\n\nI was delighted when I saw the new location was on Carothers, closer to my abode. Take-out after COVID was a game changer for restaurants, and I decided to mask up and help out a business. \n\nWe all got burgers (see my Ground reviews for why I picked a new place). \n\nThe burgers were meh. The fries also meh. It was not some flashback to the first bite from back when it was in Brentwood (insert visual of the food critic in the animated movie Ratatouille when he finally tastes his meal). In fact, it was a, \"Sorry, I overpromised and they under delivered,\" to the family.\n\nMy hope is Corner Pub was just working out the kinks. With that in mind, I'll wait a while and give them a second chance. The location is central, but I've seen several places come and go in that area of Mallory. If they can get back to the basics, it will be nice."

Walking in they have completly wiped out anything from the old pub except the bar but it was nice. Very roomie and not loud at all. Look forward to going back for a few pints when things get better in the world.  They expanded the patio area and lit it up really nice.  Have a full wall of tvs for game day.  Well ordered take out and they had it ready on arrival.  The hostess took the time to check the order and saw we were missing a side of fries and the manager quickly  corrected it.  We ordered the steak biscuits and they were awesome, especially the moist biscuits.  They did however forget the Aujus so I called to ask about it and the manager offered a discount for the mistake even though I only made an inquiry, not a complaint.  They were great without it.  In regards to the covid complaint in a previous review, well I did not have that experience although it was 6 p.m.  so not a large crowd.  All staff had mask on, tables were far apart and the few people at the bar were far apart.  Even though they took my favorite pub away I look forward to enjoying the new atmosphere and hopefully  see some of the old gang there.  Usually would give it a three but since the manager took care of the minor issue without me complaining and was so nice about everything I added a star for great customer service."

There was 1 large party in the restaurant, but otherwise it was not busy. There only appeared to be 2 bartenders working to make drinks, run food, and bus tables. After getting our first round of beers and an appetizer, it took 25 minutes for anyone to come back to our table (beers had been empty for over 10 minutes).

I like that the shrimp was cut up so that it was flavoring but not over doing it. It was about $8, however the average to small portion size would have been a bargain had it been $5. The only other major gripe is the soupy dish should've been served to go in a plastic container since it can easily leak into the bag using the platter boxes they use.

Both locations have pretty much the same menus, but there are a few differences like the bread they use for certain paninis or the taste/consistency of their pesto aioli.

Several musicians who played there have gone on to much bigger music careers. All this right there on Rock Block! That's all gone away. Owner sold it to a criminal who abused workers, physically & mentally. So did the previous owner somewhat. I knew people who worked there for many years who had to leave due to the very bad change of atmosphere. It wasn't safe any longer. It didn't help that sometimes clients got over zealous & started a fight now & then. It used to be a better place. Again, new owners who said they wanted to recreate the old neighborhood atmosphere.

Prior to Covid they were posted up in the Funk Zone, but now they have a late night brick 'n mortar space within the shared space of Kim's Service Department. It is sandwiched by its neighbors, the Shaker's Mill and Modern Times Recreation Academy. Previously in this space was Cubaneo, but they have given it a retro-nautical 'shark attack' vibe. I personally love the fun touches of decor, particularly the old TV with a fish tank. I was awaiting Nemo's appearance. :P\nI ventured in during their soft opening to get my hands on a classic New England Lobster Rolls. Even given our coastal location, this is not something that is easy to come across. BSOC offers both a lobster roll prepared warm with butter or cold with mayo. I had to order one of each with a side of crispy fries. My partner and I brought them along for a wine taste down the street. Lobster Roll + Chardonnay = Heaven on Earth! While it may be a slight sin to admit, their reddish Old Bay (or so that's what my taste buds think it contained) dipping sauce that came with the fries also paired perfectly with the mayo lobster roll. :X\nGiven that this location is brand spankin' new, you could tell they had experienced staff and own the eternally popular Malibu location. The staff worked hard as a team. One example was when I had requested my order for takeout, one person prepared the sauces, another plated it nicely, and the final person bagged it up for me.

This business is a brand new, Santa Barbara location not to be confused with its restaurant in Malibu, CA some 75 miles away from Santa Barbara. It needs its own dedicated Santa Barbara location Yelp business page. \n\nIt's incredible to witness the massive evolution of what started as a humble food stand pop up achieve a pretty hardcore cult following. Those who ventured down to Malibu to get your BSOC fix after the SB pop ups stopped know exactly what I am talking about. Hungry foodaphiles stood in the cue for hours to get their hands on a lobster roll. \n\nThe new Santa Barbara restaurant is sandwiched between Modern Times and Shaker Mill, formerly home to Cubaneo. It is a must visit for the BEST Lobster Roll on the West Coast. Feeling fancy? Top your roll with world renowned SB local Sea Urchin, caviar or both! Don't forget to grab an order of oysters on the half shell to slurp down. \n\nI am looking forward to seeing what exciting additions are added to the menu once the new SB based team gets its sea legs. The Malibu menu is pretty extensive. \n\nAs far as the ambiance goes, I love the throw back beachy vibe - any 80s or 90s child can appreciate it. Given the current prevalence of COVID19 I am also thrilled with the option to take my gloriously enormous tray of seafood outside to the patio at Modern Times with their delicious beer. Yes folks, you can take your food and roam about the building freely to Modern Times or Shaker Mill if that floats your boat."

Next thing I know, he's got a hot spot in Malibu. The lobster roll is a must, but don't skip out on the burger! We had the fried shrimp too, and boy were those plump, sweet and juicy!"

It had no seasoning to it; no garlic, no salt pork, nada.  Worse Mofongo, I ever had.  It came with a small container of sauce, so once the sauce was gone I threw most of the Mofongo away, I tried to eat the fried pork which were nice chunks but they were either fat or too chewy; waste of $15.00!  I don't live nearby otherwise I would have driven back with their tasteless Mofongo, they made me.  Lesson here:  taste food before you drive off.  A Bodega $4.00, Mofongo, (without the fried pork) tasted a lot better.  For what you are paying this Food Truck, you should go into a sit down restaurant because if they forget to season your food and/or give you poor quality fried pork you can have them bring you out another plate.  I really thought I would be getting a true Puerto Rican Mofongo, but it was tasteless; like eating plantains without salt.  Very disappointed.  Not sure what the issue was and/or if I can try this place again."

However, when I first arrived it took about five minutes for the waitress to ask me for a drink when there were (counting me) three people at the bar. I was then asked if I wanted to run a tab in my card was promptly taken.... no big deal I kind of get that but it just seemed a little odd. I got the chips and queso and it was out in literally 5 minutes so no telling how long it had been sitting underneath the heat lamp. The chips were stale and the cheese, after you broke through the crust on top,  was not too bad. There then was a shift change which I found odd considering the place opened at 4 and this was only at 6. The new bartender did not seem all that enthused to be working there at that moment. I had been looking at a menu because I was going to get something to go but the new bartender promptly took the menu and stashed it under neath the counter. Thankfully I knew what I wanted. As of this writing I have not yet opened my burrito but I'm hoping it's going to be worth the almost $70 I spent for 4 drinks chips and queso and a burrito. I do not see me going back there again."

It looked very appealing and the cheese was browned just right on the top of the pizza. One thing i noticed was that my sausage and pineapple were on top of the cheese but the pepperoni was under the cheese., interesting.  Now the pizza was good and tasty and i didn't even have to ask for extra cheese because they pile it on.  I know i tasted some provolone and im not sure what other cheese because the provolone was dominant.  So if you di not like that particular cheese, this is not the pizza for you.  Mu children didn't like it so much because i think they're just use to mozzarella base pizzas.  I also ordered the veggie alfredo.  It as warm as well and the ingredients, fresh.  Now im starting to act like my children but i love fettuccine alfredo and i feel like they messed up because they melted some provolone cheese on top of the alfredo.  Now im sure i would've loved this when i was younger on a drunken night maybe but i really wanted some regular fettuccine but i will take the hit for that because the description said melted cheese in top, i just didn't ask what type of cheese, i assumed parm.

We dialed the number right away and were connected to customer support. At 8:54, we spoke to Mark (employee number 7530). He informed me that the store had closed and that he could provide me with a store credit. I stated that I needed my money back, and he told me that if I wanted my money back, I'd have to return the day-old pizza the next day. I requested to talk with a manager.

He refused to give me his employee number and said \" there's not need to beat a dead horse.\" I explained that we cannot eat the pizza because we do not eat pork, and it seems reasonable to return our money. He refused. Upon further investigation I noticed that the store closed at 8:00pm but accepted out order at 7:40pm, perhaps they shouldn't be accepting money from customers if they don't intent to provide decent service! Unacceptable. I want my money back!\nConfirmation Number3220109184241001313038611\nOrder Date Sunday, 01/09/2022, 7:42PM"

And for most it will be the last one you ever achieve as this experience is equivalent to meeting Neo from the matrix and taking the blue and the red pill! Their crispy chicken sandwich has taken full control of my life, just one taste and you will be hooked like all the fish Hank caught in the crack fishing episode of King of the Hill. My loved ones have tried several interventions to attempt to manipulate me away from this tasty, juicy, spiritual-esk experience that is the crispy chicken sandwich. I've been fired from my job, lost my wife and kids, and have just received a foreclosure notice on my house. But not to worry, as long as this Popeyes continues to serve this life changing food item I will be in constant nirvana. Thank you Popeyes of Trenton, NJ. You have elevated my life to heights before not even believed possible. Your staff are angels and your food is other worldly! I look to the heavens every time I order this and give my heart and soul to the man upstairs who created the Popeyes staff who have single handedly changed my life"

You can travel far and wide across different countries and cultures but you will be hard pressed to find anything comparable. Popeyes in general has a pretty good chicken sandwich, HOWEVER, this locations sandwich is a glorious gift bestowed upon us from the gods. Would I order anything else? Of course not! I will eat this sandwich every day for the rest of my life to show my appreciation and dedication to this delectable bird on a bun. If there was a religion about chicken sandwiches, they would need a particular sandwich to look up too... to write books about, this chicken sandwich at this location would be that entity. Deliver us from dry chicken, and forever hold the warm bun. For one can lose faith in the chicken, and be brought back to the light with this simple, small, inconspicuous Popeyes location in Trenton, NJ. Thank you for serving us, and thank you for the best damn sandwich ever created"

It doesn't hold a feathered and beaked candle to the Chick Fil A Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Chick Fil A's vastly superior version actually has the spices and flavoring seared into the breast and the hotness is perfectly matched with the Pepper Jack Cheese and the mayonnaise cools it off. \n\nUnlike the disgusting sandwich I couldn't even finish choking down from Popeyes, the Chick Fil A sandwich isn't overly thick or ridiculously breaded. It just didn't taste good. The breast was too thick, the sauce didn't improve the sandwich, and there was no cheese.\n\nIt also just looks sloppy and messy and didn't taste any better than it looked. Chick Fil A's sandwich actually looks deliciously tasty, there isn't meat hanging out all over the bun, it's compact and appealing and inviting.\n\nThis is the crappiest chicken sandwich I have ever eaten at a fast food chain. Chick Fil A's is the gold standard and Wendys' Spicy Chicken Sandwich is much better. I would have been better off ordering McDonald's Spicy McNuggets which is considerably better than this overhyped tripe.\n\nAvoid at all costs or don't listen to me and fall for the TikTok hype pretending that this sandwich is life-changing when, in fact, it was nothing but vomit-inducing."

It's truly upsetting she had to deal with this after she just had a long day and just wanted some comfort food. Below is what happened to her:\n\n\nI have been a regular patron at this restaurant for years. However, today I was appalled by the way I was treated at this location by Inbran. I placed my order, pulled up to the window, Inbran read back to me my order, and I explained it was incorrect. I proceeded to repeat what my order was, including 3 apple pies. She said, \"We don't have any apple pies.\" I informed her that the person who took my order, confirmed they were available. As she yells at me, \"We don't have any and we are about to close\" (half an hour before close time), another employee began to place the apple pies in the bag. She then proceeded to rudely ask, \"Well, are you going to pay or not?\" Taken aback by the consistent animosity, I simply told her she could've just acknowledged making a mistake and I was unsure as to why she was being hostile. Then, she slammed the window in my face. \n\nI would think, especially during these times that businesses and people are struggling to pay bills and make ends meet (due to COVID-19), you would want to maintain customers and repeat business. However, Inbran is pushing customers away. I asked another employee for her name and was advised that this has been an on going issue with this same person that is supposedly training to be a manager, which prompted me to write a review. She very clearly doesn't have the capacity to de-escalate situations, lead by example, or at the very least..provide good customer service."

Under $5 for a filling and tasty treat. I ordered the spicy version. While it wasn't too spicy, it was certainly hot and crisp. The inner meat in the breast burnt my fingers as I ripped it apart. Soft and juicy. Really liked it. Actually gave me two wings along with the breast.

Second I think the owner maybe from China as I can tell from the menu are based in China as it follow the cuisine from China and Shanghai. Anyway enough talking, today I order a few dish to try. Steam Pork Bun \u83dc\u8089\u5305, BBQ Pork Bun \u53c9\u71d2\u5305, Pan Fried Pork Bun \u751f\u714e\u5305, Yang Chow Fried Rice \u63da\u5dde\u7092\u98ef, and General Tso Chicken \u5de6\u5b97\u68e0\u96de. \n1. Steam pork bun is on point, the look, size, and taste is good. I recommend this bun, but I don't think it should cost 2.5 a piece, maybe it's inflation.\n2. BBQ Pork Bun is also on point, but I think this is a mini version because the regular one is usually bigger. The pork is lean and without fat which I like, sauce and taste is good, the bun itself is soft and good. I recommend this.\n3. Pan Fried Pork Bun, this is a Shanghai dish, what I received could be bigger, usually it is bigger size in Shanghai. The taste and look is good, I recommend this.\n4. Yang Chow Fried Rice, this dish is missing the main ingredient BBQ pork (Char Siu \u53c9\u71d2), instead it used shredded pork which is ok if you don't know, to me this is more like the American version of house special fried rice, also it's missing green pea. It need more taste, it's missing its fragrance. I probably won't get it again.\n5. General Tso Chicken, no doubt this is an American dish and I don't care much for it, but my wife is American and she love this dish so she got it, the chicken just a little smaller than most Chinese restaurants, but it looks ok and my wife say it's good and it's spicy. I don't think any Chinese restaurants can mess it up but I recently got one from a dim sum place up in this area and it's awful. \nOverall I can recommend this place and will continue to try different dish like soup dumplings and beef chow fun. The price is ok because you can't find a place that serve dim sum up in this area if you are craving them. My order is for takeout and not dine in, so I don't know how the service is."

Radish was great!\n\nWe shared the pork and chives steam dumplings, scallion pancakes, sesame chicken and beef chow fun. Winner was the beef chow fun! Delicious with a ton of flavors. I would definitely order this dish again. Loved the veggies that were inside as well.\n\nScallion pancakes sadly gets a big thumbs down. Came with a good amount, but way too over fried. Could not taste any scallions and could only taste fried dough. Drenched it in sauce and it still didn't help. \n\nDumplings were great and the filling portion was very generous! Sesame chicken was good, but just average. Normally sesame chicken is a dark brown with lots of sesame seeds. This dish was orange like orange chicken and had a small sprinkle of seeds. This was just okay!\n\nI can't wait to return and reorder the beef chow fun and try new things off of the menu!"

A pint when for $9.00 you should get a quart.  Taste is OK. Not going to complain.\n\nFish ball soup $6.00.  Nothing special.  Tiny portion, maybe a cup and 4 fish balls.  Worth $3.00 at most.\n\nPork fried rice $9.00.  Full quart, so decent value.  But the port isn't recognizable as pork, it's ground meat, a shortcut.  Should be diced pork, not ground.\n\nI didn't try the dim sum.  If you're in Phoenixville going out to eat, it's fine, good food, but don't expect anything special. Really disappointed with all of the good reviews."

First of all the selection is not as huge as in the main location and I really had my heart set on ramen. (Ramen is at the main location.) I was hoping they also had some vegetable options as well...which they don't. What they have are Korean style hotdogs, kimbab (similar to sushi), and Bulgogi cups.  So I ordered the Beef Bulgogi Cup. The flavours were delicious but the portion was soooo tiny! It would so much better for presentation and content to throw in some green saut\u00e9ed veggies and extra rice...and it wouldn't cost a lot more.  I ended up having to order a soup at the Thai restaurant to fill up on something. For a snack this is probably a good place to go, especially if you want a different take on a hot dog or fried chicken. Not the best bang for your buck if you want to be filled up at lunchtime."

It's right in the food court and I don't usually have to wait long when I order here. There's a lot of fast fried food options that are varying in sizes, I typically opt for those items when I'm at the south side location, but I've been leaning towards the k-dosirak at this location. It's basically like a quick & easy Korean bento which saves me from having to decide what to eat because it's a nice sampling of different food that's not overly greasy or messy. The spice level is actually quite tolerable- it seems mild for someone like me who has barely any heat tolerance. K-dosiraks are also packaged nicely and travels well so I can enjoy it back in the office.  I'm pretty happy gangnam street food has expanded to kingsway and will likely hop over here again for food and bubble tea when I'm in the area for lunch breaks."

Sadly, they recently adjusted the menu and removed a few of the more obscure, hard to find items but 90% of what was there is still available although by different names. \n\nHighlights include anything with bulgogi (Bibimbab in particular) and the Cheese Dog (which is like a big mozza stick). The chicken bites are good but recommend the rice bowls for a more substantial versions of the same. They now have monthly specials at a discount which is a great way to try them out. \n\nNote: The Bul-Dog is a unique menu item only available at this location. Worth trying."

They don't start your food order until you get to the front of the line and they take your order ticket. Everything is mostly pre prepped but still. Overly crispy fries and absolutely zero attempts to not cross contaminate- my steak sandwich and fries came with some chicken tender breading and my husband watched them dump falafel in with chicken and fries so good luck to anyone strictly vegetarian I guess.

Gloves aren't magical, if you touch stuff with them they are contaminated just like hands would be."

Mind you, my initial meeting with Southtown Hyundai was back in 2011 and I got a sleazy salesman at the time so I stayed away. This time was much much better. Straight talker, not pushy, asked important questions and listened to my answers well. I was lucky too that I met the sales manager who sold me two vehicles when he was still at West Edmonton Hyundai. Done deal in half a day. Got the car early next day. I didn't appreciate the finance lady being pushy about expensive add-ons which I clearly indicated I didn't want. That was the sour point in what would have been a great afternoon. Also, the service area seems a bit small and they don't offer free service like West Edmonton Hyundai does. Love the low interest for 72, 84 or even 96 months. Why buy used when you can get a new car with lower monthly payments. Always check for their slaes events because they often have them and it often covers most models."

We visited many dealerships and test drove many cars, but I finally decided to purchase a new Hyundai Elantra from Southtown Hyundai.  I had visited the dealership at least three times prior to making the decision to purchase, and when I was ready to buy the car, we felt very comfortable with our salesman and also the choice I made.  As soon as the deal was handed off to the sales manager at the time, things started to get difficult. \n\nI picked out the trim level I wanted, and decided on the color I wanted.  My dad and the sales manager worked out an excellent price for the car, and we were thrilled that we were getting such a good deal.  The color I wanted was popular, so they had to find a car to ship in to Edmonton.  They found one in B.C. for us, and when we looked over the paperwork we discovered that it was a test car with over 30,000 km on it, and they were going to drive it to Alberta for me.  Not ship it on a truck, drive it - all the way from Vancouver.  I was paying for a new car and wanted a new car so we insisted that they find a different vehicle.  We had to ask a lot of questions to finally get a straight answer about this particular car, and if we hadn't asked questions, they would have driven in the test vehicle without telling us it wasn't brand new.  After another short wait, they found one for us that was new and would be shipped in via a truck. We paid for the down payment on the car (with the rest due when we picked it up) and walked away smiling with our signed contract.  \n\nThis was on a Saturday, and we were to be sent the bill of sale for the car on Monday so I could get insurance and registration for it.  They didn't send us anything on Monday, and we called on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday asking for the bill of sale.  The manager wouldn't return any of our calls and when he finally did the excuse we got is that the color I wanted was impossible to find and that there wasn't a single one available in Western Canada.  What did I pay for then?  My dad was suspicious and called a few Hyundai dealerships in Calgary - we found eight Elantra's matching the trim level and color I wanted.  \n\nOn Thursday night I finally decided I didn't want to deal with Southtown any further and we called to cancel the sale.  The sales manager's reaction was to say \"fine\" and hang up on us.  As this was my first experience car shopping, I was crushed that it ended so badly, and did not even end up purchasing a car that summer.  A few years later the new sales manager found my open file and couldn't figure out what had gone wrong and called me to see if he could \"make it right\".  Since I was no longer in the market for a car, there wasn't anything he could do, but even when I went back to test drive an Elantra in 2011, I still could not get over how bad my first experience was."

When we got there the salesman greeted us politely but then kept telling me it was a manual car...obviously I know it's a manual or I wouldn't have called in to test drive it. The majority of the time we were there he would talk to my husband which pisses me off because I'm the one buying the car. I ended up buying it definitely not because of the salesman but because of the car.\n\nIn the year that i have had this vehicle, I've realized the service there is crap. If you call and ask a question they never know off hand and always say they'll call you back, but then they never do. If I take my car in for service their shuttle service won't drive me to my work downtown and will only drop me off at the nearest LRT station...but every other dealership I've dealt with drive you downtown. They're not helpful and it feels like they don't care about their clients and they're very pushy."

But then I had to take it in for an issue in July 2013 and I have to say that this service department is the worst service I have experienced. Took a week to get the car in. Then I didn't hear from them for three weeks because they were \"having trouble finding the part\".  Every time I call this department I get bumped back to reception because no one answers the phone. After the fifth time of being bumped back to reception, even the receptionist was annoyed and she sighed and said, \"They never answer!\" When I went to the dealership to get a copy of the work order, I stood at the service desk for five minutes without getting any attention at all. I was the only customer standing there. The assistant manager was having a personal conversation with the shuttle driver and everyone else was just sitting there. I wondered for a moment if I was invisible. I finally had to go stand RIGHT in front of the computer one guy was sitting at to get noticed.\n\nOf course what I needed done wasn't covered by warranty and I was quoted $700 for the repair. I got a quote from another place for $300 less. They got back to me the same day I called them and can get my car in this week. So, I called to cancel my appointment at Southtown...and go through the same ritual of being bumped back to reception over and over. Finally I get to speaking to someone and I am told there is no appointment for that day for my name. Why am I not surprised?? \n\nI will NEVER go back to this place again."

After our great experience with Go Auto Direct, but choosing to purchase a new vehicle, we ended up at Southtown as they too are part of the Go Auto group, and they are located close to our home.\n\nWe made an appointment to see George on a Friday night to test drive several models.  He was very helpful, knowledgeable and quite funny as an added bonus.  He was never pushy, and gave us time to discuss our options.  He helped us get a great deal on a 2015 Tucson as well as our trade in, which we were very pleased about.  We definitely recommend George!\n\nOur experience was slightly soured by our interaction with the finance aspect of our purchase.  The woman we dealt with on the Friday night kind of rushed us through some paperwork without much explanation and told us the rest would be explained when we picked up the vehicle.  We asked about securing the loan and other vehicle options (ie. undercoating, rust proofing) and their effect on the price, but we were told the vehicle's price was the final price, which didn't make sense.  When we were asked when we wanted to pick up the vehicle, and we suggested several days later, we got told we should pick up the next day, which we were a bit surprised about.  We didn't think that would be enough time to have the vehicle ready, but we were assured it would work.\n\nThe next day when we arrived, we were told the vehicle wouldn't be ready for another two days.  Thankfully with the Go Auto group we were able to get a loaner vehicle.  We then saw another finance person, who proceeded to sell us the other vehicle options we had asked about previously.  We had no problem waiting for our SUV, but would have appreciated a phone call to tell us about the delay.  When I did finally pick up our SUV, there was still a fair bit of plastic covering that I needed to pull off myself.\n\nWe will be returning to Southtown for our SUV's servicing, and hope that the service department is as great as the sales staff!"

He is a great sales associate some may say and I would agree to a certain extent since I found his car knowledge to lack proficiency. \nIn other words, he may know how to sale a car perhaps but can only sales talk you into purchasing one with very basic information about the car, which may portray him as a knowledgeable sales man. \nQuick tip: Ask for all the details up front with Micheal Castro (from my experience). Do not work out a deal before he shows you the AMVIC and made you aware of all the car conditions. That way, the deal may be reasoned efficiently. On the other hand, Genevieve's patience amazed me. Kudos to her. \nP.S. My experience may differentiate from some others and this is not to say that the salesman is a bad one. I am simply telling the truth.

To make a long story short, the \"courteous car wash\" that I patiently waited for was done at a very very poor quality. It makes me wonder of the service I received on my car today.

He is a great sales associate some may say and I would agree to a certain extent since I found his car knowledge to lack proficiency. In other words, he may know how to sale a car perhaps but can only sales talk you into purchasing one with very basic information about the car, which may portray him as a knowledgeable sales man. Quick tip: Ask for all the details up front with Micheal Castro (from my experience). Do not work out a deal before he shows you the AMVIC and made you aware of all the car conditions. That way, the deal may be reasoned efficiently. On the other hand, Genevieve's patience amazed me. Kudos to her. \nP.S. My experience may differentiate from some others and this is not to say that the salesman is a bad one. I am simply telling the truth. At the end of the day, he made the mistake and I still had to pay the extra $2250, which was not the deal we originally worked out. He did not advocate for me, regarding this extra amount I had to pay. That is what I find shameful."

I understand that these are tight times for everyone, but why risk losing customers?  Meet us halfway!

I'd imagine due to staffing/covid. The pizza was a little undercooked for my liking as it wasn't firm when folding the slice. But the taste was excellent.

Still, tasty and tasted very fresh. BUT, bring cash, or just avoid this place. Im kinda upset with how my lunch scenario went. My lunch special came out to 8.65 and I only had $8 in cash. So, like everywhere these days, there was a $10 minimum for credit card purchases. (FYI, that practice is illegal if a place accepts any card more than AmEx....), so I bought a piece of cake that I didn't want, to meet the minimum. My new total; $13. Huh? The freaking slice of cake was 3.50, there was a ADDITIONAL 75 cent charge for using the card, and THEN they rounded up from my total of 12.90 to $13. THEN, and this is the kicker, my special came with a can of soda, which they didn't have, so they tried to charge me an ADDITIONAL dollar for a 16 oz substitute.

Just can't order it until you get there then pull over and wait like 15 min for the order. \nNeeds a new system where you can order ahead and be charged correctly when you are picking it up."

Then you have the shrimp with a light panko breading seasoned with herbs and devined, yes they cleaned them from the black vein ! The fries have a light crispy taste to them. They are similar but seasoned better than KFC's new fries.  You'll have to wait in the assigned parking spot, but SO WORTH IT! Or call ahead?! And finally but certainly not least they had the prettiest, smiling cashier. Who was so patient with all my questions, taking my order Thru drive thru. My receipt says her name was Lashawna.

I've seen this in online passing a few times and had it in the back of my mind as a place I had to check out.  With everything going on as of late, curfews, shut downs, its hard to gauge hours of a lotof places that say they are open but aren't so it took me a bit to get here finally, but I did.  I pulled into the drive thru which had a large menu but you order at the window, which made it easier and more personable. Ordering went smoothly, I went with both wings and fish.  They make to order, which I was hoping, it was a short wait, you are directed after ordering to a numbered spot and your order is brought out to you.  My order was packed perfectly, even down to the extra sauces requested. They delicious smell peeked through the foil pan and into the car on my short ride home.. I unpacked and was pleasantly surprised everything looked great smelled great and tasted great!  they only really had fried offerings so I stuck with fish and chicken no sides except an order of hush puppies and fries came with the wings... everything was A+++.  I'm so glad to have an affordable place like this so close by with great hours, everyone in the house enjoyed.  Only thing I regret is not visiting sooner, will definitely be back soon & often!"

This was one of the only Ethiopian restaurants that made Ethiopian tea the right way with a pinch of hot pepper and hand-roasts Hararr coffee for their coffee ceremony.   The balance between heat and spice was spot-on for the western palate and they gave us a little extra berbere spice to sprinkle on top!

I actually have been to Ariano before for dining under the stars but that was before they added this on. The girl running the gelato section told me it's been there for about a year. \n\nIt was a lot nicer inside than I anticipated. There were bar stools up against the wall/windows and there were also a couple of tables...one big one. You can have Ariano food served there. That seemed odd to me. Personally, I wouldn't want to dine at that table where people are in and out buying gelato. But that's me. \n\nThe girl running the gelato counter was extremely nice. She had great customer service. She explained how everything worked, that the printed menu wasn't always up to date because a lot of the gelato is seasonal and changes often but you can add a shot of espresso OR a shot of liqueur to any of the gelatos. She said we could order a single scoop, a double scoop or a \"home made\" which was a triple scoop...you could combine any flavors. \n\nWe were able to try as many flavors as we wanted before making our final decision. I was shocked but I actually liked the hazelnut better than the Nutella crunch...and I am a BIG Nutella fan! The cherry amaretto was good but I wouldn't get it again. The hazelnut was definitely my favorite. My man got pistachio and Oreo, both of which he enjoyed. I love that the gelato was nice and cold. I've been to places where the place isn't cold and the gelato itself isn't cold. I was happy to have a nice, cold gelato!\n\nWe took them to go. Service was quick. She did explain to us though that she makes the desserts for Ariano as well so sometimes it gets backed up if people are waiting for gelato and servers are waiting for desserts. \n\nCute little establishment, clean interior, delicious gelato and great service! We will return and I highly recommend other people give it a try! I'm glad they had a Groupon available so I was able to be introduced to its existence.\n\nOne drawback...I really needed to use the lavatory but there weren't any located on this side, I would have had to go to the main restaurant side and I felt weird doing that so I waited until we got home."

Through the Uber Eats app, I ordered the Egg & Avocado Toast and Healthy Elvis Smoothie.\n\nWhat was given to me was Avocado Bread with Scrambled Eggs... yuck. While this may not sound like a big deal, if I order \"toast\" I expect it to in fact be toasted. Why would anyone on planet Earth want breakfast BREAD not toasted?? Also, the fact that there wasn't an option to choose what egg you wanted seemed silly to me. I assume avocado toast comes with a fried egg (there was a photo on the app that showed a fried egg but it now shows scrambled eggs). A suggestion for management is to add egg preferences on their Uber Eats app - fried egg, over easy, sunny side up, poached, scrambled, etc. I was going to eat it anyways but after traveling the avocado had made the bread mushy and it was not edible (hence another reason you want TOAST).\n\nThe \"Healthy\" Elvis tasted like a milkshake..... While I love a sweet smoothie, I want it to have a smoothie consistency and I wasn't a fan of their smoothie. \n\nI may give it another chance in person, but was super disappointed. Avocado toast is pretty simple to master and theirs was all wrong."

Nonetheless, I had high hopes that my investment would be worth it. I asked for 1/2 banana on both of the bowls, which to me, was a simple instruction- both bowls were served to me with way too much banana. The bowls also had way too much granola to even taste the fruit or a\u00e7a\u00ed at all. Furthermore, the a\u00e7a\u00ed and the fruit were very mediocre quality and there was very little of it. I will never be returning this to place. Frutta bowls on elliston place is much better and way more reasonably priced. The employees at grain and berry were nice, but the food was not nearly worth the cost (also the building was so hot on the inside) I don't even think I would eat it for free."

The bowl however, was really disappointing. The base was guacamole and it was very obvious that the guac was the cheap premade guac that doesn't taste very good and I suspect is made with very few real avocados. Unfortunately the cherry tomatoes were also not at the peak of freshness and were limp and tasted old. The rest of the ingredients were okay but the bowl in general was severely lacking in flavor (even salt wouldn't made a significant improvement). I love all of these ingredients separately but together they made for a mushy, unsatisfying bowl. I think fresher ingredients would help but I think some nuts or seeds are also needed for texture.  For a $12.75 bowl I would absolutely expect fresh ingredients so I'm pretty disappointed in this and I won't be ordering again."

The salad trio came first.  The wakame (seaweed) salad was perfect.  The dressing was light and flavorful and fresh and not too oily.  I then moved onto the calamari.  A little squid sat in front of me and I was a little scared, so I went for it.  It was chewy and delicious!! I will have that again for sure.  Then I ate the edamame....they were dusted with salt and perfectly cooked.  \n\n\nThe salmon came next.  I have never seen salmon sashimi done this way but I really enjoyed it!  The salmon was nicely cut on an angle and fresh with a slight drizzle of two different sauces and red onions on the side.  I didn't use any soya sauce as their preparation was perfect!  The fish was fresh and sweet with the complimenting sauces. \n\nLast came the week bowl.  The eel was nicely done and the bowl included a nice helping of veggies and rice.  I ate the tomato, corn, wakame and one piece of broccoli.  The broccoli tasted a bit off to me (no seasoning and I don't love broccoli) so I left the extra piece.  The eel was nicely done and a good sized serving.  The only thing was the bowl was kind of luke warm, including the eel.....and I have this thing with food....it either has to be freezing cold or piping hot or the nurse in me is having an issue.  It was still delicious and I will probably try it again just to see what I get! \n\n\n\nI will definitely be back!! Check this place out if you are looking for something fresh in the area!"

Dining with one other, we ordered gyoza, seaweed salad, red tiger roll, spicy salmon hosomaki, salmon sashimi and green tea. The portions were beyond small, perhaps enough to feed one person, maybe just. \n\nFour tiny pieces of gyoza ($5.50) arrived tepid, but of course, when the serving plate felt like it just came out of the freezer. The red tiger should have been advertised as 4 pieces, but it was 5 cut rather finely. The red snapper on top of the rolls were definitely not fresh. And the spicy salmon hosomaki reminded me of the rolls you can pick up at any 7-11 stores across East Asia, yes, it of that quality; fine, if you're wanting to eat something on the run but we were neither on the run or in 7-11. The hosomaki was not restaurant quality. The spicy sauce over-powered any taste of the salmon. The salmon sashimi ($10) came and again thinly sliced, not because of the mastery or expertise of the chef. The daikon (bed of white radish served underneath the sashimi) was crudely sliced and dripping with water. \n\nWith the bill at just under $40 for two, plus green tea, it lacked value and taste. It was only $40 worth of disappointment, even though neither I or my companion had any expectations. Kamiyo is neither Japanese or fusion Japanese, it is just bland food masked as Japanese cuisine."

However, as soon as you enter you will notice that these guys had a complete renovation. The restaurant now looks bright and welcoming in contrast with previous businesses. \n\nThe menu was a little bit strange. I always like to stick to simple rolls when I go to a sushi bar (e.g. Tuna maki and Salmon maki) but their menu only had more complex roles like rainbow and dragon. So I asked the waiter if they can make simple maki roles and the chef was super flexible. He technically told use he can put whatever we like inside a simple Maki role. \n\nThe fish was fresh and the Maki was roled properly. I also liked the presentation. The price was really good. 4.5 $ for six piece Tuna Maki. However, there was something wrong with the soya sauce. I am not sure if it was the low sodium version or it just tasted watery. Anyway not my favorite. \n\nThey also give you a piece of good quality chocolate (Lindt) with the bill instead of usual candies. It was a very nice surprise. \n\nI will defantily go back there.

I think it's because there is only one person cooking. The rolls are sliced very thinly which is easier to eat but if you are expecting 8 pieces but in reality it's more like 6 pieces at another restaurant you will feel a little ripped off. The two servers were friendly enough but didn't come check on us to see if we needed anything. No water or tea refills and we had to ask twice for our bill. Don't try paying in cash because they don't have any change - as in they couldn't break a $20. The servers were more interested in watching the cook make rolls than helping us.  The restaurant itself is nice, well decorated and plays modern music so at least you're comfortable while you wait. There are just too many great restaurants in town for me to come back to this one.

Grabbed a high chair to put my son in- strap was broken. Brought that back and grabbed the next one.  Strap was broken. Brought that back and looked at the 3rd and last high chair - strap broken. All were also dirty. We grabbed one but I asked the three girls working if they had a high chair that was not broken. They all came out to inspect the high chair and then said that's all we have. I asked how long the high chairs have been broken for and they didn't know. I tried to obtain owner info to send an email or something to advise that as a customer the High chair straps should not be broken. I told the girls I didn't want to write a note for him. And they told me that they would give me his info. Finally when ready to leave I asked if they wrote it down. They advised that the owner isn't comfortable with people reaching out. So I left my number and will now leave reviews. I'm surprised as a owner of a business in the neighborhood that he would be scared for a patron to want to contact him. Interesting."

After doing some research I discovered this truck runs under two names...Loncherra Los Charros or Tacos Los Charros. Their Facebook page shows signage for both. Regardless...it was a new place for me so I had to give them a try.\n\nThe lady taking orders was very pleasant. The menu is pretty simple and presented in English and Spanish. I elected to go with a chicken burrito and two asada tacos to get a little variety. The tacos were great. The burrito was just average. Interestingly there were little bits of corn kernels and peppers in the burrito. It reminded me of mom trying to trick me into eating vegetables as a kid by camoflaging them in something else since they aren't actually listed on the menu. Part of the rice perhaps?\n\nThe good...The price points on the menu are perfect for lunch. $6 for the burrito and $1.50 per taco. The service was quick. They include radish and carrots on the side with both items. Yes...your veggies are good for you if you're eating this many carbs.\n\nThe bad...The burrito was not terrible, but it wasn't great either. They also do not accept credit cards. So in this case, lunch actually cost me $20 because I had to loan $10 to a coworker.\n\nGiven the lack of one definitive brand identity, I'm not sure if this place is changing ownership or relaunching. I'd be curious to see if they have the same issue a couple months from now. Definitely worth a go if you want some cheap tasty tacos."

I ordered buche, carnitas, and chorizo tacos and they were all amazing. My favorite part about this truck is their salsa!! Man do they have amazing salsas. It's a red and guacamole salsa, which you don't find just anywhere.\n\nI didn't carry enough cash with me so the lady worked with me so I can have a taste of all 3 tacos. They were pretty quick too!  I only waited about ten minutes, whereas other places it would have been longer. \n\nI can't wait to come back here for more tacos! I love their salsas and the quality of their tacos."

I will say this adds so much to the already amazing tacos. The Carne Asada is fresh and soft. The tacos are filled very generously with meat and toppings. The salsa they offer is very flavorful. They have 3 different flavors.  Avacado,  verde and Rojo. The Rojo is hot and flavorful at the same time. Prices are decent and I actually frequent this establishment every week. If you can.... give it a try. You will not be disappointed."

OK, enough about the burgers. Did I mention the fries here are the best in e-town (although there aren't any official plaques to that effect - yet!)? They're so good I don't even care that they don't come with the meal; you have to pay for them separately. But it's totally worth it.

The Farmer's Market in Old Strathcona was the perfect beginning to a full day of putzing around town during the first truly summer-like weekend of the year. We arrived early, bought colorful vegetables and said hello to some old friends as we drank tea and sampled everything in sight. Who needs breakfast when you can have free salsa, pasta, jams, taco chips, dips, and green onion cake at 8 am?\n\nWe made out way back to our place and parked the car around 1 as we pitched ideas for our first restaurant stop to start the 3 Block Challenge. We noticed the Garage Burger Bar and Grill on our way down 106th street, stationed beside the Metro and familiar as a place we often passed by on our way to the downtown Farmer's Market last summer. Perfect. 1/2 a block away and open, ideal for our hurting feet and even more hurting stomachs. \n\nThe Garage has been open for 8 years. It is literally an old garage converted into a small and very modest restaurant. The booths and tables are clean, but there is really not much else to the place. The walls are painted red and there are a few daily specials signs on the walls, but no art otherwise. We were greeted and seated quickly and found our place along the wall in the front of the restaurant, amongst a couple other occupied tables of families and hung over young people. \n\nWe started with a couple Diet Cokes that were quickly delivered to us in their original cans, sans straws. The menu was extensive, featuring a variety of pub style appetizers, sanwiches, and burgers. Heath decided on a Garage Burger which was a beef patty with ham and cheese and all the veggie fixings. I decided on a Buffalo Burger which was on special, which was a buffalo patty with all the veggie fixings and a generous portion of fries. We also ordered some sweet potato fries to start. \n\nThe sweet potato fries came quickly and right out of the frier. They were warm and crispy, yet moist and sweet on the inside. We poured some extra salt on to even out the sweetness of the potatoes, and I also added some vinegar to my portion. Our burgers quickly followed. They were huge. The buffalo was nicely cooked, still slightly pink in the middle and deliciously accented with everything I would put on a burger at home: onions, lettuce, a fat slice of tomato, melted cheese and relish. Heath's burger reminded him of a \"rink burger\", which is a classic burger at all hockey rinks in Lloydminster and the surrounding area. We both finished our burgers quickly, perhaps a little too quickly, and attempted to finish off the fries without much luck. We thanked our server for letting us take pictures in the restaurant and paid our bill, totaling $31.00 with tip."

Naturally I had to give their food a try.  The fellow at the counter greeted me as I walked in. I asked him what a shawarma is so he patiently explained that it's served the same way as a donair but the meat is prepared differently. He then offered to give me a sample of chicken shawarma meat and naturally I obliged. It was quite tasty so I decided that since I'm picking up supper for my wife and I, I should get one of each.   The total with taxes but before a tip was just over $26.00.   In a few minutes my order was ready to go.\n\nUpon arriving home I cut each one in half (not an easy task for food that should be unwrapped gradually as eaten). This way we could both try the donair and the shawarma and see which one we like best.  As it turned out my wife arrived at the same conclusion as I did.  We both enjoyed our meal but found the donair did not have a lot of flavour.  On the other hand the shawarma was delicious!  When ordering it I took the counter guy's suggestion to use garlic sauce.  Perhaps it was that combination, I don't know for sure, but it had the flavour that makes me looking forward to my next shawarma, and not splitting it with anyone.  \n\nNearly every time I've eaten a donair or shawarma I've picked it up as a take-out order.  However some people must eat in as there was plenty of seating in the bright, contemporary and clean dining area.  You certainly won't have to stand while waiting for your food.   They have free TELUS WiFi but don't serve coffee.   I'm glad to see that Mac T Donair and Shawarma has opened up in this part of the city as there are not many in the southwest. If you come I certainly recommend the shawarma but if you order a donair be sure to share your opinion of it here in Yelp."

Due to their failure to carry certain healthier options, I had to choose between chips or no side at all.  I eat at Subway because it is a healthy way to get a quick meal.  Obviously, the franchise owners of this location are not as health conscious as I am. I was glad to see that they did carry the avocado topping, but the last time I ordered it, they had not even removed it from the atrocious plastic bag in which it comes.  Instead, they cut a hole in it and squirted it  onto my salad.  Disgusting.

I'm trying to support my local restaurants, but these last couple of times have let me down. It's very frustrating!\n\nTo sum things up, my family and I ordered delivery via Uber Eats for the first time. The UE driver did fine. No complaints there. She followed directions perfectly.\n\nThe problem was with the order from the restaurant itself. As a matter if fact, we ordered four sandwiches and all four of them had at least one thing wrong! That is a horrible percentage!\n\nWhat I concluded is that they were either out of the ingredients to make the type of bread we ordered or they ran out of the pre-baked loaves and the new ones weren't ready to come out of the oven when our orders came in. Three out of four of our sandwiches were supposed to be with the Italian Herbs & Cheese bread, but instead, Subway made all the sandwiches with plain Italian bread.\n\nThe other problem was not getting our choices of cheese for each sandwich. Two sandwiches were correct, but they totally skipped putting the Pepper Jack cheese we ordered onto the other two. Again, maybe they were out, but they made no effort to contact us to select another option or to cancel our orders and try something else.\n\nThat, however, didn't stop them from charging us for our order.\n\nNeedless to say, this experience is going to make me think twice about ordering from this location again. There's something to be said about how you treat your customers and do what's right versus settling for less, and offering poor service instead.\n\nSad.

An extremely dangerous, poorly designed street set up with traffic lanes not wide enough to accommodate the continual double parking of trucks and self entitled luxury car owners. Service in most of the establishments is poor to horrible, so at your own risk. The Gulch also has the only coffee shop in the known world, from Italy to Cuba to Oslo, that does not have cream or half and half for their overpriced coffee. Hilariously after several failed over pretentious awful coffee shops that couldn't make it in a prime spot, Starbucks has now taken it over. I had no less than two near fatal encounters of drivers who did not see me or just run over pedestrians at will. This isn't the real Nashville; it's a faux version of a New York City block. Ten Years ago the Gulch was fabulous, in the days of 12th and Porter, days long gone. Some of the restaurants might be ok, but it's unlikley I would ever try more of them after the disaster at the four I have, which shall remain unnamed since they all will likley close within two years.

Parking is plenty as you can park in the parking garages. The one beautiful thing about the garages is that you can park for free for one hour. A good way to see the sights and not pay for parking. The What Lifts you Wings are awesome and kudos to the designer: Kelsey for her magnificent creation. They are truly a sight to see. If you are in the Nashville area, be sure to visit the Gulch and be sure to see the What Lifts you Wings. Your trip will be just that much more memorable in this awesome country music capital of the south."

There are fashionable hotels to stay in, boutiques to shop at, awesome restaurants to dine at, cool bars to grab a drink in, local art to check out, and there's so much more! This area seriously has everything.  \n\nWhen I visit the Nashville office of my company I always park at The Frist Art Museum, which is nearby. From here it's easy to pop over to The Gulch, whether you're walking or driving.\n\nIf you're in Nashville, be sure to head over to The Gulch to see what you can find to see, do, and eat or drink! I'm sure you won't be disappointed."

It's not the party central area of Nashville which is either a positive or negative depending on what you expect to get of the city. I'd you're a foodie, it's a great area. The well-known Biscuit Love has it's main location here. There's also Milk and Honey, Burger Republic, several other restaurants, bars, and breweries. There are a few apparel stores like Urban Outfitters, Loft,and some boutiques. \n\nSome cons of the area are how the walking crosswalks make an annoying chirping noise when you can walk. There is no bodega or drugstore and reasonably priced market nearby. The Turnip Truck is on the pricey end for groceries.\n\n The Gulch has mix of a local and tourist vibe. A place like Biscuit Love will have a line at all times. The breweries seem like a place for locals to gather. This area also doesn't play non-stop country music like other places in Nashville, which is a plus in my books."

They nail that aspect perfectly, and easily earn a three star \"A-OK\" rating. \n\nIf you are looking to adopt a cat...I would recommend just going to a local shelter.\n\nThey have an odd rule here. You are not allowed to pickup the cats.\nIf I had to list the number one thing I love about cats it would probably be lap cuddles, and there's just no way to get that experience here unless one randomly happens to jump into your lap.\n\nIf I'm looking to adopt a cat (I am), the first thing I would normally do is pick it up and see how it reacts. You can tell so much about a cat about how it reacts to be picked up and placed in your lap. \n\nNot being able to pickup the cats creates a rather sterile, cold atmosphere. \nI absolutely get why they do it (and I knew the rule before I went) but I wanted to see how it worked in practice. The result is a very 'unCATisfying' experience that feels sort of half-baked.\n\nYou can go to almost any shelter and interact with the cats much more and get a better feel for them as potential pets. \nYes, a shelter will smell worse, and not be as chill and modern in design, and have more \"damaged cats\", but the shelter experience, in my opinion, is more rewarding (and free!)"

When I called to inquire, they said they would remake my order - though since it had been two hours since I originally ordered, I was not surprised nor did I care when that never arrived either. Food, service and punctuality were all terrible. I recommend spending your money elsewhere - this was the worst dining experience I've ever endured."

At 9:30pm on a Friday, the wait was about 20 min. We ordered 2-14\" (8 slices) cheese pies with a 2 liter and 5 bone in hot wings for $25. Food was hot when we picked it up and was pleasantly surprised at the quality. The pizza is New England style aka Greek Pizza, tasty ingredients with a crispy thick crust. It wasn't too oily or greasy, nothing I had to use extra napkins for. The wings were super yummy!  I was a bit apprehensive after reading a review about how bad the wings were but I found them to be meaty, nice sized and just the right amount of spicy kick....definitely finger lickin' good!\n\nReally looking forward to trying other menu items soon!!"

However, I just ordered their buffalo wings and they were the absolute WORSE I have ever had. Almost editable. Many places use these cheap junk chicken wings that hardly have any meat on them. Then they overcook them and you are left with shoe leather. In fact, the shoe leather would be tastier.\nI have had their cheese steaks a few times and they are pretty good. But again, like other places, they overcook the meat. The meat has finished cooking (a little too long) and THEN they put the cheese on. It's now been on to long. They don't realize that the meat will continue to cook in the roll on the way home.\nThe meat should be taken off the grill the second the pink goes away. \nIf I had to rate them on their wings alone, I would have given them one star. \nBut to be fair, I will order some of their platters and rate them.\nUPDATE - 7/8/16 - I have eaten here quite a few times and although I will not order their wings, many other items are very good. I am not a pizza eater but did order one to try. Very good. I have ordered many of their pasta dishes and are also very good and very good value. Baked ziti...you can hardly lift it.\nCheeseburgers - excellent. The owner made it so that may have something to do with it.\nSalads - again, very good.\nTheir portions are big and as mentioned, their pasta dishes are very good and good value."

Just hadn't had a chance to Yelp until now. \n\nAnd I will unequivocally say that they're better than the previous establishments in this location. It's better than both Tommy Doc's and Goomba's were. I can say that pretty confidently. \n\nTonight though they slipped a bit. My wife ordered a large with 1/2 pepperoni and 1/2 chicken and broccoli with a couple of appetizers. \n\n10 minutes after she called, they called her back. They asked her if she had ordered a white pizza. No we had not. \n\nWe get the delivery in a half hour (they're always quick to the door). We look at the pizza. I should have thought to get a picture but I didn't. \n\nSo they apparently \"fixed\" our pizza. I suspect they originally made the chicken and broccoli side white. But upon realizing the error they didn't make a new pie. Instead they dolloped sauce on top of that side. Because we got a pie where the pepperoni side had the sauce under the cheese and the chicken broccoli side had it on top. \n\nDid it taste fine? Yes although slightly overcooked this time (slight burnt taste this time around). But it was sauce overkill on the one side as a result. \n\nHonestly, it was a little weird. I'm torn as to whether they should have made a new pie for us as it would have delayed things. But you kind of expect that on a Friday to begin with.\n\nPlus the apps we got on the side, a sampler and buffalo fingers, were just ok this time around. I've had better. I've also had worse for sure. \n\nThis place can get busy I've noticed. They have a lot of staff there. They seem to really get orders out the door quickly as evidenced by prior deliveries which were as quick as 15 minutes on a weekend. \n\nI'm wondering if being busy combined with their rush to get deliveries out makes them prone to slip ups now. I suppose other reviews in the future will confirm this. \n\nPlus, I'd probably go easier on them if they were cheaper. Higher pizza prices mean higher expectations. \n\nThey're good. But it's a fine line between being good and being just like everyone else."

It looked great and was a solid pizza.  The sauce to cheese ratio was just right and although the pizza had a tad more grease than I typically enjoy I can't say it was bad.  The crust was crispy, dough was fresh and the cheese was as well.  \n\nIf I was in the area I would definitely stop in again."

The sandwich was quite hefty.  My husband enjoyed it thoroughly.\n\nThe beans and coleslaw, however, were sickeningly sweet.  There were some crunchy pieces of celery in the baked beans - that were undercooked.  They were not made of your typical white bean but were, instead, a mixture of beans with what looked like maybe lentils. The green beans were spicey,  needed salt, and also slightly undercooked.  \n\nI'd go there again but I would only buy meat, with sauce on the side, or one of their sandwiches.

The meat was beautifully rare and all the toppings (mayo, Cooper Sharp cheese, tomato, onion, choice of sweet or hot peppers, evoo, oregano, salt and pepper) worked well together making for a sandwich I'd be pleased to order again.\n\nThe odd:  spicy green beans.  I've never said this before in my life about a  restaurant dish, but, here goes:  it was too hot.  The beans were cooked nicely (slight amount of snap; not overcooked nor undercooked) but all I tasted was heat.  If there was seasoning, I honestly couldn't tell.\n\nThe bad:  ribs.  These are advertised as \"baby backs with a li'l more meat on the bone.\"  Yeah, no.  They were pathetically puny and highway robbery at $14.00 for a half rack.  Really a shame they don't offer spares or St. Louis style ribs like a true BBQ place would.  To their credit, it's evident the ribs were made authentically.\n\nI'm also going to take them to task for charging $.75 for a side of sauce.  BBQ places in our area know this is flat out nickel and diming and discourages guests from sampling what looks to be a nice variety of homemade sauces - that's why they don't do it.

The first one was round, like a funnel.  The outside crust was high and 3-4 inches without sauce, center was thin. We got it with pepperoni, the thick kind that ends up being a cup.  Not my favorite kind but was tasty.  I actually liked the crust, it had a good yeasty flavor.  Second pie came as a free form rectangle, still tasty with similar crust.  Just sloppy looking, no consistency.  This guy can't control his dough.  Today was the worst, still a rectangle.  Dough was doughy, not cooked well, dense and the flavor it had before was gone and replaced by that burnt garlic taste you get at Domino's.  Sauce was super thick and slid off the slice when picked up.  Then there is the coullion sauce, which ruined what could have been a good catfish sandwich.  There is no definition on the menu, so getting it is a crap shoot.  Its a very spicy mayonnaise based sauce that prevented me from tasting anything else. The addition of tomatoes and lettuce is done so sloppy that everything falls out.  Ended up just eating the fish.  BTW, the definition of coullion is testicle, a slang Cajun term for f-ing stupid.  I really wanted to like this place,  Really.  The menu makes my mouth water, but the execution is a failure every time.  No coullion for me"

After a brief hold, a friendly employee took our order and advised it'd be 15-20 min. Pick-up wound up taking a little longer, but mostly because the employee who was handling orders got tied up taking a large phone order around the same time we arrived to pick it up. \n\nI ordered the Teddy P, which comes with fried oyster mushrooms, cornbread, and choice of two sides. The fried mushrooms were outstanding --- flavorful with perfectly crispy breading and a texture surprisingly similar to fried chicken. For my sides, I got the Vegan Mac, which was creamy and delicious, and the collard greens, which were flavorful but tasted a bit salty after a while. The cornbread was on the sweeter side and a little dry, but overall really yummy.\n\nBF got the Phyllis Hyman, which includes \"krab cakes\" made from hearts of palm and jackfruit that achieves a texture and taste very similar to the real thing. BF also got the vegan mac, but ordered the veggie stir fry --- a well seasoned vegetable medley. He really enjoyed his meal, though said he's planning to order the Teddy P next time.\n\nOverall, a great first experience at Go Vegan --- can't wait to try more of the menu!"

This was more than enough for two people. We had leftovers for the next day.\n- The food was delicious! When you order, they ask you the level of spiciness that you want (mild, medium and spicy). We ordered it medium and I'd say that this would be enough for most people. I'll probably try the spicy next time, but I like things REALLY spicy. If you're not much for spice, I would recommend trying the mild initially.\n\nService:\n- We were quoted 30 minutes for pickup, but it was probably closer to 50 minutes by the time I was out of there with the order. To be fair - the restaurant is new and getting a lot of word of mouth AND it was Friday AND the neighbourhood has really been dying for a local food place.

For a new business, I didn't receive a very warm welcome. I think they could work on their customer service skills, even though I was just picking up an order. \n\nWhen I opened my food I was delighted to see a lot of naan. The quantity of one order varies from restaurant to restaurant so I always order two just to be safe. This place doesn't skimp on naan. I ordered two garlic, however, I received one garlic and one regular. I was surprised to see quite a large container of Shahi Paneer but when I opened it, it was mostly just sauce with barely any paneer; luckily I have lots of naan. I asked for mild spice but the food had quite a kick. I would be afraid to order the spicy option! Unlike most places, they leave the spices in the sauce (think chai latte spices) which are unpleasant to chew on when enjoying your food. \n\nOverall, I won't rush back to this place considering there are many better options around the city."

The prices are reasonable and the selections are mostly, if not all mainly North Indian ranging from variety of  chaats (Indian Street Food),  Curries (Veg/Non Veg), Breads, Assorted Rices.\nWe usually order their Mutton Curry ( CAD 14.49 ). What I love about their curries is they always serve a plus one Naan (Bread) free of cost! The only downside has to be the amount of oil they use in their food which is quite high. All my instructions while placing an order is to reduce oil.\nTheir Samosas (Veg, Chicken- CAD 1.50) are good as well! Served with Tamarind chutney (tangy) and Mint chunty (minty/spicy).\nIn short, a decent place serving Indian dishes right around the corner for last-minute fixes!\n\nVFM - 2.5/5"

When restaurants first open up I always like to try their daily specials or happy hours so I don't have much money invested if I don't like the place. At Hoots I tried their boneless Tuesday special. Which consists of a half order of waffle fries and 10 boneless wings any sauce for $7.99. At the actual Hooters this would be much more expensive. One of my main concerns about this place is the location. When I walked in the door their was a homeless man with his private parts hanging out asking for a cup of water. The manager immediately showed him away. I am curious to see how they are able to control the homeless and maintain cleanliness standards. The Starbucks across the street smells of urine, I hope this location doesn't turn into that. \nNow back to the food. Overall for the price the food was very good. Both the wings and fries were very crispy. However where Hoots makes money is charging an extra $1 for any sauce or blue cheese. In my opinion an order of wings should automatically come with a side of blue cheese. Charging an extra $1 is ridiculous."

Every bite, every sauce, every plate has been considered before it gets anywhere near your table. I've had more than a few dumplings in Japan. I haven't had any better. And, I've eaten more than my fair share of Japanese shaved ice. This is perfect . Try everything. EVERYTHING!"

The dumplings aren't huge but are perfectly fried with crispy outside and soft flavorful filling. I'm actually still dreaming of them and considering ordering them again tomorrow night ha!\n\nSpicy Numby noodles were so spicy my husband couldn't finish but i thought they were great. \n\nYou absolutely MUST order the dessert-\nWhite chocolate something (sorry can't remember  the name, it's long). It's an absolutely heavenly cream-filled light pastry dessert that we couldn't get enough of!!! But it would have been sinful to get two orders for just the two of us ;p\n\nBottom line- get all the dumplings, and definitely save space for dessert."

Portions are on the smaller side, and service is somewhat slow (we ended up waiting ~20 minutes for our food after we texted them that we arrived).\n\nShrimp Toast: 4/5\nLoved how the outside was crispy and buttery while the inside was fluffy and stuffed full of shrimp. Only thing was that I thought the sweet chili sauce on the side didn't add much.\n\nTsukemen Dipping Noodles: 4/5\nI could tell that the noodles were fresh, and the ajitama (ramen egg) was cooked perfectly. The chicken broth was also packed full of umami flavor and had a decent amount of heat, which I enjoyed. Although the chicken wing was tasty, I couldn't detect much of the scallop. Another thing is that since the noodles were served cold, they stuck together in one big clump, and I had to use my hands to pull them apart.\n\nWhite Chocolate Kartoffelkage: 5/5\nThe star of the meal! Wasn't sure what to expect, but this ended up being a giant white chocolate cream puff layered with caramel and surrounded by a thin blanket of marzipan dusted in cocoa powder and sprinkled with candied fruit. All the components complemented each other to make a truly unique dessert."

Apart from the dumplings and the oysters, there wasn't one dish that we had ever tasted before -- and both of those were as delicious as the rest. We ordered everything on the menu, including the dreamy shaved ice desserts. It's expensive -- about $280, including the service charge and plenty of adult beverages -- but a splurge worth taking."

I was finally able to try it this past week and I honestly don't get it.... although the staff was friendly, the service was painfully slow. Waited a long time to give drink order and even longer time to get food. The wait for the food was absurd. The dumplings were actually pretty good, but the shrimp toast was one of the most disgusting things I have ever had. The texture and appearance of the stuff inside reminded me of spam. It was encased in a breading that tasted like it had been fried 10 times. It was so greasy and so gross. Maybe you just need a certain type of palette to appreciate this food. But I will never go back."

Maybe it's because they literally make them by hand per each order? Maybe it's magic? I also felt like I was transported out of 12 south when we were chilling in the patio. So kudos to the designer for that seemingly impossible feat! The shaved ices (we had both), were like gifts that kept on giving. As I dug deeper new flavors and colors emerged!! I also wanted to give a shout out to the noodles from hell, they were amazing as well. It's 8 am many days later, and I can still imagine them in my mouth. Thanks Locust!!"

The staff was also incredibly nice and knowledgeable! We got the steamed dumplings, fried dumplings, noodles, and 2 chocolate salted caramel shaved ice. \n\nThis place is definitely somewhere to go after you've eaten dinner or you just want a snack. The menu is basically 4 appetizers, 2 types of shaved ice, and then 4 types of drinks plus whatever special they are having that night. The steamed dumpling (which was 9 dollars) only had 6 dumplings. The prices seemed very high for the quantity of food. The noodles were 13 dollars and were not our favorite. And you don't get that many noodles. We probably won't order the noodles again if we come back. The noodles themselves were pretty good, but the sauce wasn't our favorite...\n\nIn my opinion the menu was very expensive for what we got. It was 70 dollars for the 5 things we ordered!! 20% gratuity is automatically added to tab. \n\nIf you come here, just get dumplings and shaved ice. The shaved ice was very good!! But be prepared to spend quite a bit and you will probably leave a little hungry."

We've loved every single one so far, especially the English tea kakigori with marmalade jam. Doesn't that just sound delicious? We also just had their scallop-stuffed chicken wings an hour ago, which was beyond this world delicious. In fact they were so delicious I had to write this review to do them justice. Their tsukemen was very tasty too and hope it comes back someday. They have a takeout counter and plenty of outdoor patio seating, which is perfect in the era of Covid-dining and feels very safe. What did Nashville ever do to deserve a place like this?! Please do yourself a favor and stop by Locust the next time you're in the 12 South area. I promise you won't regret it!!!"

We had everything on the menu, and couldn't get enough of the dumplings (we had multiple orders). They were so moist and perfectly complimented by the chili oil that was paired with it--and I'm not one for spice. On the other hand, the cold noodles were delicious, but too spicy for someone who is sensitive to spice. That still didn't stop me from cleaning my plate! To cool my mouth from the noodles, I used the cucumber spears dipper in their special salt. They added the perfect balance of cool and refreshing with intense flavor and a little oil to offset the noodles. I loved the shrimp pillow, and couldn't believe it when I went back for seconds (not a seafood person AT ALL). Another favorite of mine was the beef tartar, which was brought out separately from the other ingredients, allowing you to create your own beef tartar sushi roll. The beef was so rich and buttery and paired excellently with the freeze dried capers, rice, and seaweed. To top off an already perfect meal, we had both shaved ice desserts. The almond salted caramel was by far our favorite. It was an almond milk shaved ice with merengue on top and finished with a thick drizzle of salted caramel on top. It was the perfect combination of sweet, savory and salty, and it was SO light! You didn't leave feeling overly full, but rather perfectly content. \nWhile this isn't a typical restaurant, the atmosphere and experience are truly one of a kind. If you're looking for a quick, grab and go place to eat, go somewhere else. If you're looking for extremely friendly staff, who focus on creating relationships with their customers and who provide you with an experience you won't forget, go to Locust!!"

I would suggest this for an experience similar to small plates rather than a full, sit-down dinner. Great blends of flavor. It was sort of a take on Asian cuisine with a fusion flavor vibe of East-West. Staff was incredibly friendly! Parental warning: At times, the fairly loud, not-dining-music isn't kid-friendly (@!&@!\"!). Health-conscious diners will also be very disappointed with the lack of vegetables.

I've learned how to cook them well... however, once I tasted one of Locusts Dumplings, I realize that I never even knew what a true dumpling was until now. It was soft and delicate but crispy with a perfect crunch and a savory mouthwatering pork filling. The Trader Joe's dumplings that I've loved for years have now taken a backseat. Never did I know that I could love another dumpling more. I highly recommend skipping Trader Joe's and going straight to Locust...or in all reality, skipping any and every other place where you can buy dumplings and going straight to Locust. You won't find better in Nashville. They also have other food that's good as well, but I've never made shrimp toast or cold noodles at my house before so I can't compare them to my home cooking but they were pretty damn delicious.  \n\nDear COVID, please end soon so I can enjoy there dessert and cocktails in person."

After waiting for weeks for this reservation, our hopes were high and literally every dish was underwhelming. We ordered a bottle of wine. Our server visited the table maybe twice during the meal. The check included 20% gratuity (on a party of 2) and service was terrible. I am extremely disappointed in the food, service, ambiance, and experience as a whole.

We also ordered the cucumber appetizer, which came with an innovative dip of salt and powdered sansho. Sansho is commonly used in Japan but is a rarity in the US. If used at all, it is an accompanying spice for grilled eel. I have a sansho plant at home and use the tongue-tingling spice for a variety of dishes. The sansho/salt dip worked perfectly for the appetizer. The cucumber was delicious but I would have left the skin on to prevent the sweaty slippery texture of the spears. The spicy cold noodle was a bowl of thick udon with a chile-sesame- canned bamboo shoot paste that you mix up. It was good but the thick noodles made for difficult eating. I would have preferred this with thin Inaniwa-style udon noodles. We eagerly waited for our dessert and were surprised by the giant box-like presentation of the shaved ice. This version covered and smothered the shaved ice, rather making it a centerpiece. The point is to cool off by eating this concoction. What we got was a fast-melting marshmallow-like dessert."

I do wish their menu option was just slightly bigger, or with the small menu I wish their plates were slightly bigger. Make sure you make reservations!"

Outstanding dumplings, we ordered another round because they were so good.  We had blistered peppers with a delicious dipping salt.  They had fresh mackerel that day and we ordered 2 rounds of that, it was so simple and perfectly made.  A dozen oysters later and a few shrimp toasts, we were blown away.  \n\nLocust is a place that has perfected the menu they are serving, everything is just so intentionally simple and refined.  You can tell that great care and thought goes into each dish.  The service was outstanding, and the staff greets every new arrival with a \"hello, welcome, good to see you\", its hard not to feel at home there.\n\nThen came the shaved ice.  It haunts my dreams to this day.  I wanted to live inside of that desert and never leave.  \n\nJust go to Locust and enjoy everything about it, we will be back soon."

We stopped by this pack weekend. As of January 2021, they are open for takeout only due to COVID. So, we ordered on Toast, drove over, parked, texted a number letting them know we were ready, and they texted back to let us know our order was ready at the takeout window. Easy, quick pickup. We ordered their dessert on the menu this week - a tea and cookies kakigori (a Japanese-style shaved ice) - which (because it's shaved ice) can't be made ahead or packaged to go. So I walked back to my car with a bag of dumplings and shrimp toast in my left had and the bowl of kakigori in my right. We ate it first also (I mean, it's ICE!), and it was great: icy, creamy, with great flavors. Then we had the shrimp toast - which was definitely a different take on shrimp toast than I've had at other restaurants. But it tasted great! Beautifully fried! The dumplings were good, too! And we were able to eat this whole meal in our car while everything was still hot or icy! A fun meal overall! I do think their menu is pretty limited (they only offer one type of dumpling - pork), and they don't offer anything for vegetarians except for the dessert (we aren't, but just FYI). In a single visit, we tried everything on the menu except for the Tsukemen dipping noodles and the other dessert on the menu. Still, if a meal of pork dumplings, shrimp toast, dipping noodles, and a fun dessert sounds like a meal you want to try - check out Locust. We enjoyed everything we ate!"

WHAT IN THE WORLD HAVE I BEEN DOING?! Locust is by far my favorite meal in Nashville. It filled a gaping hole left in my life when Setsun closed. I got home and could not stop talking about it to anyone who would listen. My husband got tired of listening to me and frankly I got tired of talking. It was time to eat again. After texting like 4 different babysitters slowly going through dates round and round one finally had an cancellation and coincidentally Locust had one remaining reservation. It was meant to be.\n\nSaturday evening my husband and I were finally going to eat at Locust together. Now there is always the fear that when you talk something up so much that the other person will not feel the same. There was zero fear here. Locust lives up to the hype. The best part though? It's an amazingly delicious and fun meal in the cutest, most casual space. We ordered the entire menu and one special. Each one was as special as I remembered with one exception. Last time I had a vegetarian and pregnant person with me so we skipped the beef tartare. DO NOT SKIP THE BEEF TARTARE. It's the best item on the menu. It's probably the best beef tartare in Nashville. I don't want to ruin all of the nuances to it so you'll just have to trust me. Eat it. Enjoy it. Soak it in. I could not stop smiling the whole meal. It's probably the happiest I have been in months. I can't wait to go back, I'm not even joking. It's our anniversary next month and I've already been checking their reservations."

Everything about this dish was so satisfying, but save room for dessert. I didn't know what to expect with \"shaved ice\", but this blew every dessert I've ever had in Nashville out of the water. It's hard to explain outside of \"wow. Holy sh*t\" because the textures seem contradictory, but it was super light and still satisfies your sweet tooth with the caramel drizzle and (I think) custard-like filling with some small toffee pieces inside. My only piece of criticism was the spoons were aesthetically pleasing but not exactly the most functional because they were pretty shallow. It translates to: I needed a larger spoon to effectively scrape each plate because every single thing on that menu was divine."

Why? Well, I find that Impossible \"meat\" is fairly tasteless, and I figured that it was the perfect choice for a meatless fast food burger. And I was right! When you eat a Whopper, there's the taste of whatever chemicals/seasonings they put on the meat to give it that \"flame broiled\" taste plus all the veggies. The Impossible Whopper tasted amazingly similar to a normal Whopper, but I could pat myself on the head for having a meat-less meal afterwards. (If anything, this just shows that the Whopper isn't that great of a burger, since it proves that you don't taste beef just everything but the beef.) \n\nSo if you need a fast food meal and want to skip eating meat, the Impossible Whopper is not a bad choice. Of course, if you want a really good vegan meal, try the Mediterranean Chickpea, only a couple miles away."

The following week I get there at 9:02pm, and no one again answers the drive thru. I pull around and knock on the door, they talk through the door and say they are closed.

This generosity definitely costs them more, but keeps people coming back for more!\n\nI think my favorite menu item goes to a Taco Dog though.\nAwesome Hebrew National Hot Dog, in a nice roll.

It's definitely cozy. We ordered something light to split. Two beef tacos dressed to order. The tacos were literally annihilated in 2 minutes !!

The first time I had a ground beef burrito - it was MASSIVE! The biggest to date! Everything was fresh and delicious! Being a Cali girl in Louisiana, I was skeptical to try their version of Mexican foods! I was pleasantly surprised to say that it was tasty and really really delicious! Their refried beans were good, and not can tasting! Their rice was super flavorful and very good! They got a good couple of salsa's but their corn salsa is where its at! Not to red onion'y and just very well executed! \n\nThe 2nd time I ate there, I decided to have the taco salad. The chicken was very moist and tasted yummy! The salad was fresh and crispy and very green, their black beans are OK, nothing to brag about, but the salad came out really good , and you get a massive amount of food, for what little you are paying! \n\nThe guys that run the joint, are super cool, personable and nice. I found out he was originally from Texas, and he owns the place with his family. Its weird cuz they cook and sell Mexican food and Hot Dogs and then they got a frozen custard side to the shop .. Frozen custard, what is that you say? Just pretty much one of the best frozen treats Ive ever tasted! I only had a spoonful of it, cuz once you eat there, there is really no room for dessert! \n\nIts very very clean and the boys that work there are in tip top when it comes to service!

                "text": "Newly opened, family owned and operated, small Thai eatery in a remodeled space at a west Boise strip mall.  (Location orientation: same strip that has Lindy's steak house on one end and Guido's pizzeria on the other.)  Frank and  Pisutkan (Pitsi) Adams are the owners, she is from northern Thailand and she and others from Thailand are doing the cooking.  It may be that Frank and the nice young woman who was our server are the only people in the mix who are not part of the Thai heritage family.\n\nThese are early days (take out started late October, dine in started November 2) for this small business' kitchen and they are still gauging customer demand.  One day in October take out times they were literally bought out of food after a Boise newspaper article reported they were open for take out. At peak times the small kitchen needs time to fill orders.  As a customer I recommend approaching this with grace and perspective.  As in considering a delayed meal or sold out item from a small, newly opened eatery is an inconvenience not a life tragedy.\n\nTAKE OUT - DINE IN:  If our lunch time experience on their second day of dine in service was typical for less than a dozen people in the roughly 50 seat eatery but with a good number of  people coming in pick up take away, it may be that people are unaware dine in is available.   Now you know! \n\nSERVICE:  Full table service and server was covering the dining room and bar seating  areas and managing take out orders.  She was friendly, knowledgeable about menu, efficient and clearly enjoyed working there.  Both she and a cook who came out of the kitchen as we left thanked us for our business.  Very nice.\n\nMENU / PRICES:  The same menu is used lunch and dinner and focuses on: \n\n*noodles (3 kinds $13.50 - $14.50) and noodle soups (4 kinds $14.50), \n*curry dishes (5 kinds $16 - $17), \n* tom soups (2 kinds $$14.50 - $17.50) and salads (3 kinds $12 - $13), \n*specialty rice dishes (4 kinds $13.50 - $17.50),  and \n*starters like crispy rolls, fresh rolls, chicken wings and... (7 items $9 - $11)\n\nGOOD FOOD FIRST VISIT & PLANNING SECOND:  My experience as disappointed consumer of Thai food in the Boise area, after having enjoyed lots of it in other cities, is that many local Thai places over extend their menus to include Chinese and other Asian dishes and do none of them very well.  The menu here is smaller which allows focus to create good Thai food in the small kitchen.\n\nGiven Noodle in the name of the restaurant we ordered noodle dishes on our first visit; pad thai - because it is for us in a Thai eatery as spaghetti with marinara is in a family Italian place, a benchmark dish - and khao soi - a northern Thai spicy egg noodle curry that is a fav of mine and not often found on Thai restaurant menus locally - in fact Mai Tai may be the only other serving it and they offer it only at dinner.\n\nWe enjoyed both dishes, although in my experience with khao soi it is served brothier than was the noodle dense presentation here.  But it was good for flavor and presented in the classic style with braised chicken leg included and Chinese style soup spoon and chopsticks for eating it in the traditional way even if it lacked the pickled mustard greens and thin sliced shallots I've had elsewhere.   We appreciated the pad thai was well seasoned and not the overly sweet, sticky finish that can be in this dish in some places.\n\nSpice levels offered mild, medium, hot.\n\nSuch generous portions that there were leftovers from both dishes to take home. \n\nNext time we'll try Thai basil rice dish and tom yum...or maybe pumpkin curry, another favorite.\n\nVIBE & SEATING:  Nice job of remodeling what was a dingy  (Chinese food restaurant) space before, it is a little dark inside, in the way of moody not unpleasant, given wall color choices and limited windows.  Seating at bar and in bar at two top tables are high seats.  Two standard height four top tables also in  bar (hooray) and throughout dining room.  We also appreciated that it was peacefully quiet.  One could hear the buzz of conversation, including appreciation for the food, from other diners and the owner greeting a diner who already was considered a regular as he asked her, \"What should I try today?\".  No piped in music, the tv over the bar was on with no sound.  Ahhhhh-some!\n\nACCESSIBILITY:  Accessible parking spaces (2) outside door in lot.  All on one floor inside, standard height tables with path of travel to and floor space at some looking ample for diners using wheelchairs as ADA requires for equal access.  They even include the ADA required standard height seats in bar which so many Boise dining places ignore.  Good for them. Didn't check the loos.\n\nPARKING:  Private lot shared with others in this strip mall. \n\nHOURS:  Open Mon - Sat for lunch until 3:00 then closed, as many family restaurants are in late afternoons to let staff eat and refresh the kitchen before dinner service, reopening for dinner at 5:00."

To get the ingredients she needs, Pisutkan Adams grows some of her own special items.  The attentiveness to getting the flavors right, really comes through in the dishes served.\n\nThe word is getting out, so anyone who chooses to wait to try this place may be missing out on a really good thing.\n\nThai cuisine is all about FRESH, BRIGHT flavors, not the sauced-over starchy stuff that some other \"Thai\" places in the TV offer.  The owners in many of those instances are not even Thai, and it shows in the poor quality.\n\nWe had the Som Tum (green papaya salad) at a level 5 heat and the Thai Cashew Chicken.  I have been visiting Thailand since 1986 and have spent many weeks there over multiple visits.  It was there that I learned about the heat of Thai food and its special flavors.  The salad was beautifully prepared and the flavors were in superb balance.  Not the soggy fishiness found in other Tresure Valley salads.  Those other places suffer from the lack of fresh & correct ingredients and in trying to make up for it, the restaurant throws in too much (old) fish sauce.  Papaya salad is supposed to be a delicate, lively dish, not something that smells like a fish tank. The cashew chicken seasoning was outstanding, the rice was perfect.\n\nThere were about 5 tables of families/couples in the dining room and the takeout was bustling.  I think we saw 10+ takeout orders ready to leave there right when the people came in the door.  That was in roughly one hour.  The kitchen was working hard.  \n\nThey are closed from 3-5 each day, between the lunch and dinner service, so don't be confused by the hours listed on Yelp.\n\nThey have 5 different noodle soups in addition to the standards of Tom Kha and Tom Yum Koong.  There are 5 different curries.\n\nThey have 6 brews on tap.  Totally recommend the Tangerine Wheat Beer and Mac & Jacks Amber.  They pair well with the food.  \n\nMichele R. review hit the nail on the head with regards to the quality and taste of the cuisine from this business.\n\nOne reviewer needs to go back to Las Vegas and take her bad attitude with her.  Scoring a place that has been open less than a month with a 1-star is soooo low class.  Very non-Idahoan.  These hard working folks do not need your disrespect.   \n\nWe strongly recommend Boise Thai Noodle House.  Join us as we go back, and back and back...can't wait to try the Larb.\n\nSuggestion: have them add some spiciness (1-5) as it really wakes up Thai food.  Walk on the wild side - you can always dial it back on a subsequent visit."

I ate there once and thought it was good.  I heard he opened a new location so I was excited to try it again. I have to say I was a little underwhelmed. I ordered the most basic thing (Vietnamese egg rolls) and they were out. She offered me the Chinese egg rolls. I was hesitant to try it but I agreed to it anyways. I am not sure how a Vietnamese owned restaurant has Chinese eggrolls versus Vietnamese eggrolls. The eggrolls came out hot and crispy but I could tell they were the frozen kind that you could buy and fry at home.  My son wanted dumplings and they were out of that too. I proceeded to order spring rolls and com ga quay. Spring rolls were the traditional kind, it had specks of black on the rice paper which really turned me off. The com ga quay was the best dish and my son enjoyed it.  Overall I was not impressed but I will certainly give it another try. We need more Vietnamese restaurants so I am hope they succeed. My suggestion is shorten the menu to their specialty dishes and leave out the fluff.  Service was mediocre but I don't expect anything more. Vietnamese restaurants typically has meh service."

You'd never know it judging from the outside but it can easily accommodate 100+. \n\nThey are mostly known for their pho ga and rice dishes. We stayed on par with the course and ordered the No.1 pho ga dac biet, hu tieu thap cam, and the salt and pepper spare ribs with rice. For my non-Viet yelpers, Dac Biet is generally used to indicate a specialty or combo on a menu. Let me be one of the firsts to tell you the broth was just that -Special. Just the way grandma makes it simmered on low for hours on end. The true test lies within the color of the broth. You're looking for a broth that's clean, clear while still full of flavor. Check. Check. And Check. \n\nHu Tieu, like pho, is a Vietnamese noodle soup. However, it is loaded with pork, shrimp, crab meat, and tiny pieces of crispy pork skins (more of that please!). \n\nThe salt and pepper spare ribs were lightly seasoned. But maybe they were off having an off day I'm certainly willing to give it another try. And while the portions were perfectly sized for me, the bowls looked tiny against my 6'2 bf. The current portions doesn't really allow much room for you to add in your fixings (leafy greens and bean sprouts). However, it is worthy to note that our food was served fast and piping hot. \n\nIf the weather is too hot for soup there are other options available on the menu to choose from including vegetarian. We will definitely be back for the hu tieu and the other items on the menu."

One time ate there, the food was great but service wasn't that great. There was a bigger table which she seem to be more focus on than the table my wife and I were at. This time as I sitting here eating, I want to say something. We order the same dish as last time. When the food came out, there was only one medium size bowl of white rice. We said since we ordered two dishes shouldn't there be two bowls of that rice? The younger lady said no should be one of the medium size bowl for the two dishes. She said if we ordered one dish we would get one small bowl of rice which btw only good foe one person to eat. And that person had to add more, no way that's enough. We said last time we got one big bowl with that one dish. She said there's no way. So basically she said we lied. If you add rice, they going charge you extra. So be aware of this. Food is really good but service is subpar at best."

This was my third visit and took someone for their birthday.  Would not have picked this establishment, but she did and it was here birthday, so couldn't argue that.\n\nKnowing I have had bad meals in the past, I just ordered the Filet Kabob appetizer.  Ordered it medium rare, and the waiter said he would have to tell the cooks.  COOKS?  Where is the chef?!!?  My birthday partner ordered the shrimp scampi.  So my kabobs come out, and even though most pieces were medium rare, the felt and tasted like the well done. Not to mention, over seasoned with pepper, even if you like pepper.  As for the scampi, well there was a fair amount of shrimp, but half the spaghetti had no sauce on it.  Very  dry.  The parts that had the sauce tasted fine.  The shrimp seemed fresh, and had a decent taste.  Portion size was also fine..  Lets not forget the bread and butter they serve before the meal.  Bread is nothing to get excited about.  Bakery fresh bread, but leaves a bit to be desired.  The whipped butter I would have assumed was homemade as they put enough salt in it to almost cause an instant heart attack.  This is coming from someone that uses a decent amount of salt, and it was well over salted for I.\n\nThis was not my first bad experience at Riverwinds.  Last time was poorly cooked and poor quality rack of lamb.  Service was decent.  Waiter was very attentive.  Cocktails a little under poured for the price.  For $7.00 I would have expected a much better pour.  Atmosphere was great, over looking the river and watching the snow.  Its Greek owned, so can understand why the food is not up to par.  Have never been to a Greek owned restaurant with great American cuisine.  Would not return for food, but would for the atmosphere."

A few things are better like cheese steak spring rolls, French onion soup but the filet mignon for example is just ok. The chicken is tough and thick. Scallops are often undercooked. The salad that comes with the meals is nothing and comes with a house dressing. No choices here with the menu, things come a certain way and there's little or no variation available. The kids menu is over priced....one choice is spaghetti and does NOT come with a meatball or any protein but is priced like it should have more. It's really not a great place for kids but yes people bring kids. \n\nTheir menu is limited, and very boring. Also the menu hasn't ever been updated, as far as I can tell, so it's the same old thing over and over for years. Usually every few years (at least) places add new things. You can't even get a normal baked potato here. This place could be so good but they need to re-invent their menu. It's long overdue. \n\nIt's really nice to sit on their patio in spring and fall. They do have a singer out there on Fridays. It's geared toward 40 and up but it's a nice setting for a date. \n\nAlso they have self parking or valet if you prefer. A polo and khakis is fine for men but no hats. Women can wear jeans and a sweater. I wouldn't wear sneakers but overall it's not as fancy as you might expect....from the appearance."

Yellow dye chicken stock, thick skinned dumplings, day old yellow chunky rice - just the way they taught them in mail order cooking school.  \n\nEdible, but forgettable."

I paid and walked out to the car to find only one box in my bag and it felt a bit light. I found 4 tacos in my box instead of the 3 I ordered and a quesadilla. I went back in and told them about the issue and they tossed a quesadilla on for me. It came up quickly and I was on my way. They were good about making it right.\n\nI got home and dove in. The birria taco looked great and also tasted great. The consume was on point as well. It was nice to find another solid option for birria close to St Pete. The chicken tinga was really tasty as was the carne asada & pastor. All of the tacos had a generous amount of filling. The birria quesadilla was hefty and quite filling. I had hoped it would be served with the consume, but it was not. They packed it with a solid amount of cheese and meat. The sauces that were served with the tacos and quesadilla all had great flavor and a decent amount of heat. \n\nOverall, the food was quite good. There was some confusion with the order, but they made it right quickly and I was happy with the way they handled it.

I work in the food industry and never complain, but this was ridiculous."

We got our food, starting to enjoyed our family night when she noticed, after starting her sandwich, that it was shrimp. She is allergic to shrimp. Now mistakes happen, however, this was not a simple mistake. Thankfully my mom didn't have to get rushed to the hospital. \n\nI called the restaurant to speak with the manager. Mike came on the phone and didn't believe they made a mistake. He was very condescending with his responses and even made jokes about the refund saying \"I can give for a refund for just the sandwich and a piece of key lime pieee\" in a funny tone.  I have never felt so disrespected in my life. This is my mother and if anything were to happen to her, it would have been very devastating. I asked for a full refund and was told that wasn't going to happened, but I can bring the sandwich and receipt back.\n\nWhen I went back Mike left, leaving his associates to deal with this issue that is still not resolved. Mangers are suppose to be leaders for their staff and the fact that he left just shows he is not ready for a leadership position.

Now Keep It Shrimple opened up down the street so I'm in seafood heaven. I ordered on Grubhub and decided to pick it up. I thought the inside of the restaurant was pretty cool and definitely different from the other two restaurants. I want to say it felt like a restaurant down the shore and it even had a booth area that was shaped like a boat. Anyway the hostess went to go and grab my order and handed it to me but it was definitely light. I had ordered 1lb of shrimp with sausage and seafood fried rice. I looked in the bag and saw only one tray. I said to the hostess I think I'm missing an item so she went to the back to ask. She came back with who I think was a manager and she told me everything was there. This then turned into a polite argument. I popped the tray open and only saw shrimp and sausage and I told her I ordered seafood fried rice as well. She told me I didn't. I showed her my Grubhub order and she said it didn't come through and only the shrimp was on there. Well if it did or didn't come through correctly I still paid for it. She went to the back to get the rice made and told me it would be a few minutes. She came back, handed me the bag and I didn't look back. Got home, take the food out, and it was just shrimp fried rice. No crab, no mussels, just shrimp! I called Grubhub who offered a refund but I really wanted the food. Anyway I went with the Keep It Shrimple sauce and went hot this time. Sauce was good and I liked it better than medium that I got at Express. The sausage was good and it came with a little roll with butter and garlic which came in handy to soak up some of that hot sauce. Also the rice was tasty but really wish it was what I ordered."

The texture was super mushy and the flavor was just kinda bland. While I liked all the toppings, there was just too much to even attempt to eat by hand. Not the worst thing in the world, but it was also difficult to eat with a fork and knife, plus made the \"toasted\" lobster roll kinda soggy.\n\nThe redeeming factor was probably the tater tots. They gave me a hearty portion on the side, and perfectly crispy to make sure I was filled up. May not  go back, but I appreciate their efforts to provide a vegan option at least."

The customer service is extraordinary and I always feel like I am family when I dine in. The place is always clean and they have TVs playing local sports and National Sports and at night they play really good music for the night crew to enjoy the late night crowd because they stay open till 4am!

That kind of turnaround time is impressive. I requested to pick up in 30 minutes, and when I arrived on time, I could see them putting the pizza into boxes. The restaurant has a large deck, and there is an ordering/pick up window on the deck, so I did not have to enter the restaurant. That's super handy in these COVID days, and it probably is a great convenience for people showing up at 3am for after bar pizza (they have very late hours on weekends). \n\nThe pizzas were fine. I appreciated the crispy bottom crust. My husband and kids shared a large pepperoni pizza (half mushroom). My husband commented that he suspected the mushrooms were canned. I ordered a small sausage pizza since they mentioned on the website that they used a locally sourced Italian sausage supplier. I found the sausage to be tasty but not very remarkable. \n\nThere is a small private lot next to the restaurant, so pick up was easy.\n\nI found the pizza to be fine if not extraordinary. I'm glad that there's another locally owned pizza place in South Tampa."

Wait time for a Friday night wasn't bad at 25 minutes and paying for my order upon arrival was easy as they have a walk up window outside.  \n\nI had ordered the Meaty Meat pizza, which has sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, and bacon toppings on the normal sauce and cheese pie.  Size and taste was great.  The icing on the cake for me was that the crust had a buttery flavor so it didn't have that normal cardboardy taste.  The crust was also chewy and a good consistency."

Feel free to seat yourself (we chose the patio.) we started the night with a few appetizers-empanadas, sausage + peppers, Greek salad and wings. You wouldn't expect empanadas at a pizza joint but they were actually really good! The salad was our least favorite of the bunch. It had quite the block of feta but overall the dressing wasn't your typical Greek we were expecting but more so of a vinegar and olive oil type dressing. The sausage and peppers weren't my choice while ordering but they were surprisingly delicious. Now these wings were the highlight of the night. Crispy fried outside but juicy inside. The garlic parm dry rub was intensified with the garlic sauce we just poured all over them. Honestly, some of the best wings I've ever had! Pizza was also great! Buffalo chicken could've used more Buffalo sauce for my liking but a side for dunking will suffice as well."

After reading other reviews, it seems everyone has some sort of problem here and management does absolutely nothing to fix it. Well let me just warn anyone who decides to come here, DO NOT and I repeat, DO NOT go here. I remember the first time I had this pizza, and it was from here, and I thought it was the nastiest thing ever. I got sick to my stomach and refused to ever have it again. My roommates and boyfriend on the other hand, enjoyed this pizza, so I'd occasionally have to smell it being around. A few months ago, they got it from this location and I can't believe how rancid it smelt. I told them to be careful because there's no way the pizza they served was remotely edible. It was thrown away because it was just that - gross. Just this past weekend, my boyfriend and his sister decided to share a pizza. And let me tell you.. they both got the worse food poisoning I have ever seen. It was from their pizza sitting out, for god knows how long, developing bacteria. I was so glad and am so happy that I don't eat this junk because for 5 days, they were sitting on and throwing up on the toilet. I've never seen anything like it. It became so bad, they both had to visit the ER because it turned out there was also blood involved, they couldn't breathe, etc. I know it is from this pizza place because it is the ONLY thing they shared. I WILL be calling FDA on them and hopefully this place gets shut down. They should not be a business. It is disgusting and I get that people chose to eat here because .. I mean, $5 pizza .. but that $5 can be spent elsewhere, unless you want to spend $5 to waste 5 days of your life literally feeling like you're about to die. We have records and hospital notes, etc and like I said, FDA will be called. I wish I could give it no stars because I would."

It's quieter and the outdoor patio seems bigger.  We had our two dogs with us and ate outside.  We each had two beers --I had the Heatwave Hefe and later the Desert Blonde; my friend had the Icebreak IPA and the Irish Stout.  I ordered the Hummus platter and he had the vegan nachos that he said were bland.\n\nMy Hefe had a slight waxy aftertaste that I don't remember from previous pints.  The pita bread on the hummus platter was toasted and thus hard; I would have preferred softer bread to dip into the hummus.  I'm thus docking one star as our meal was good but not mind-blowing.\n\nOur server was very good.  The patio slowly filled up as we were there for the hour"

That's a big NOPE for me.\n\nThe place itself hasn't really changed at all. They have put up flags outside, one U.S., one for firefighters and changed the sign. Mostly the menu that has changed.

I have previously worked with Wendy Gauthier and the Chef Chic staff for a private catering event before the pandemic (and they did an excellent job, BTW). However, I haven't tried their food since they opened their own store ... until now.\n\nI ordered a Quesarita, a Chicken Melt Sandwich, and fried cheese curds for curbside pickup. The online ordering process was easy, I received text and email notifications, and I arrived promptly on-time. The food was ready, brought out to be after less than a minute of waiting, and I then headed home for a good lunch.\n\nWell. Wow. Just look at the photo. They don't skimp on portion size and ingredients, the food was perfectly cooked, and I snarfed down half of the meal in no time at all. The cheese curds were buttery deliciousness and the bang bang sauce for dipping was a perfect match.\n\nThe Quesarita is big, had abundant chicken and cheese, along with black olives and maybe some green chiles. The chicken melt sandwich was equally delicious, so much messy goodness with chicken, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. For the sandwich, you can have choices for the toppings, too.\n\nI am sitting here happily satisfied with one of the best lunches I've had in a while. So, really, head on over to Chef Chic, sample the rather large selection of menu items, and enjoy yourself. I'm really glad they are in Tucson as they are a fine addition to the culinary scene here."

                "text": "Finally a BBQ spot I can truly refer to others about. By far this is the best take out bbq I've had so far in the Nashville area. Candied Rib Company is truly a unique flavor of TN BBQ. \n\nOne of the only kind (as far as I know) farm to table style BBQ joints in the area, they get their meats and produce from local farms. \n\nWHAT I ORDERED\nFrom their 9/19 Sunday menu, I ordered their Phat Daddy Sandwich with the smoked tomato bisque soup as my side, a quarter chicken, a side of \"I hate potato salad\" (potato salad), and their fudge banana pudding.\n\nHOW IT TASTED\nAs much food as it was, I still ate it all. It was that delicious. The open faced \"Phat Daddy\" sandwich had a balanced combination of flavors that brought out the flavor of the meat even more. The meat was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of fat left on it. The smoked tomato bisque compliments well with the sandwich in which I even started to place some of the soup on the sandwich itself on a few bites. That \"smokey\" taste of the soup was unique - I which I like, especially as a fan of smokey style whiskey. \n\nThe chicken was also different from many of the BBQ spots in the area. The only way I can describe it is that it tastes like a light candied glazed broiled skinned bbq. And you can definitely taste the difference in the chickens they use. Again, the chicken was cooked just right. I was recommended the white bbq sauce for the chicken by the girl at the cash register and she was most certainly right.\n\nTrying to keep this short and concise, the \"I hate potato salad\" is definitely worth trying and is different from the typical potato salads you will eat and the Fudge Banana Pudding was the right amount of sweetness and it reminded me of my mother's banana pudding. \n\nOVERALL\nCandied Rib Company is definitely a must try, especially if you're someone from out of state. Being from someone who is from Los Angeles, Candied Rib Company sets the bar and I will most certainly be back, especially on my Sundays after church. Looking forward to trying other menu items throughout the week"

Candied Rib is all about local, fresh, and perfect flavor blends. \nWe had their 'I Hate Potato Salad', chicken avocado salad, and their special of the day sandwich. *there's no pics. We ate it in the car*\nThe potato salad was the best I've ever had. We asked about the name and were told that the owner/chef hates potato salad, so he made one didn't have all gross stuff in it. Well, he nailed it. \nThe salad was top notch. Freshest ingredients possible, perfectly cooked chicken, and the dressing and slaw were just perfect. \nThe sandwich was made with perfectly cooked beef, ginger vinaigrette, and even a little pineapple (which I normally hate, but worked very well in this). The crunchy 'burnt ends' of the beef were *chefs kiss. The bun was perfect. I devoured it in about three min. \nCan't wait to go back and sample the rest of the menu!!!

Since they opened less than 2 weeks ago, we've eaten there 4 or 5 times. \n\nEach day, the proteins vary and may be prepared slightly differently which is nice. Ex. sometimes there is oxtail, some days there is goat. There has always been chicken and beef options. The pernil was really good. \n\nSince it is close to a lot of bus stops, they are having a few hiccups with estimating how much food they will need prepared each day but I assume that they'll figure out demand soon. That means that by 8pm they may have run out of empanadas for the day. \n\nThe biggest critique we have heard is where they try to accommodate an American palate. Just make standard Dominican fare and your clientele will come."

                "text": "Owner of Jeisy Grilled Chicken: Please read and correct course ASAP. Philly is home to some underrated Dominican restaurants, especially North Philly, so perhaps my expectations were too high. When I saw that Jeisy was opening at Chelten and Germantown Ave, I was excited to support a new restaurant, but boy did this place disappoint. Now, normally I would just write a restaurant off and keep it moving, but I want to give an honest and detailed review in the hopes that the owner(s) will fix the issues and improve. \n\nFirst the good, the inside of the restaurant is designed really nice. There is adequate seating. The location is central and the potential is there for this to be a good restaurant. However, the food, customer service, pricing, menu leaves a lot to be desired. The food is arranged behind the counter in a way that indicates that you can get fast and simplified casual dishes with traditional staples (chicken, rice, plantains).  However, I had to wait a while for my meal. I ordered what I thought was going to be a chicken platter with plantains, rice and beans and a side salad. Instead, I get a bed of cheap iceberg lettuce, four measly slices of unseasoned cold chicken, and the dryest rice and beans this side of Zatarains. No plantains, but I did inexplicably get some generic Chef's choice blue cheese dressing that I didn't ask for. I paid close to $10 for what amounted to season free cafeteria food. \n\nEverything about this dish was bland and basic. Furthermore, none of the staff made any effort to engage, which is a must for any new business. \n\nI am rooting for this place to succeed. The intersection where the restaurant is had a previous tenant who didn't last long. \n\nHere are some suggestions. \n\n1. Make your menu DISTINCTIVE. Scratch whatever that was that I got and work on making your meals memorable. Pull out the spices and sauces and bring some sabor. Own being a Dominican restaurant because that makes you stand out.\n2. Speed it up. You have multiple bus stops in that area. Work on making your takeout a quick in and out process. You are surrounded by fast and convenient restaurants and you cannot compete if the wait time is too long, especially for the type of food you are serving. \n3. Be personable. Talk to your customers. If you see people waiting for the bus inside of your business. Strike up conversation, offer samples of your food, do something so you can actually stick around for the long run.   \n\nApologies for this long review, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible so this business can improve and serve Germantown better."

We had 3 tacos de lengua which were average and 3 tacos de carnitas that went into the trash. Those carnitas were so dry it was like eating wood shavings. The sopes and gorditas were just ok. The plate the gorditas were on had a large whole burned through it so grease got in the bag and all over the other plates. We ordered one each of the tamales just to try them. The red was a big no. My son ate the green so it must have been okay. The rice and beans that came with the fish were inedible. Overall, most things lacked much flavor. Entire meal only came with the green salsa made from peppers and oil and it needed to be blended better. Had a very chalky taste.

Decent selection of craft beer with lots of single options so you can mix and match. Also some taps and Growlers are option. Good option if you show up to Vida next door empty handed. The downside is that now the only seating is three high bar tables in the middle. So it's not really conducive to eating in, particularly with young kids. But maybe that's intentional. \n\nI plan on going back for the pizza. I think it's better than most of the other Havertown options and I would pick up beer there if I happen to be there. The selection of hard to find high-end craft beers (eg $4-6/can) is still better at Boccellas, but otherwise you will find good options here (eg Jai Alai, Sterling Pig, etc) to satisfy your needs."

We ordered a large cheese just like Dave.  Wow! His review was a generous 7.3!  Our pizza was flavorless and not even close to good.  Oh well!  We gave it a 5.3 haha.  Super doughy and the cheese was low quality. Better luck next time."

It is very refreshing when you ask your rider where to get a beer and cheesesteak and they reply, 'the place I am going to.' All by it's self the cheesesteak was very good. The meat was plentiful, moist and flavorful. Very good amount of cheese and melt. Mushroom flavor came they on first bite. The roll; the roll was very good BUT I don't think I liked it for this cheesesteak. I would love for this roll to be a garlic bread roll and then the cheesesteak on it. My other favorite thing about Sam's is you have 3 ways to drink a beer with your cheesesteak; 1. Craft beer from cooler at Sam's. 2. Eat in McGillicutty's next door (no smoking). 3. Take ur Sam's CS to the Ivy Room (smoking). Great overall experience!!"

I had to wait due to demand and it's a little pricey, but the line to get the pizza and the amount of orders they were taking were telling me everything I needed to know. \n\nSince my weight loss surgery, this is perfect.

Boardwalk style pizzas usually have the obvious swirl of sauce on them, but there was so little sauce on this pizza that the swirl was almost nonexistent.  While boardwalk pizzas are known to be a thin pizza, this was the thinnest pizza I've ever had outside of those with a cracker style thin crust.  Ironically, while my pizza didn't have nearly enough cheese (or sauce), the cheese fries I ordered had way too much cheese.  That's a rare complaint from me, but the fries were completely soggy due to the cheese.  I'd highly suggest asking for the cheese on the side.  When I called I was told it would be 35 minutes for a pickup.  Figuring that seemed a little long, I arrived in 20 minutes expecting to get my food the moment it was ready.  My food was already done and waiting.  Normally I'd be thrilled about this, but I was told 35 minutes and had I waited that long it would have been even less desirable.  As it was, though ready before quoted, both the pizza and fries were lukewarm at best.  Who knows, maybe it was an off night for these guys.  But with all the competition in the Havertown area, it left me with a bad first impression and no real desire to give them a second try.  Just to note, it appears Sam's is owned by the same family that owns JD McGillicuddy's next door.  There is a connecting door open to the bar area which made Sam's extremely noisy.  While there aren't many tables available for eating in, if you decide to do so you may not want to bring the family during prime bar hours."

I also gave a tip. I also ordered two water ices to go which I ended up putting in the cooler because they were melting. I stood there waiting for my food which they clearly forgot to start cooking. No one said anything to me as I stood there, workers and the cook constantly had masks below their noses. Multiple people came and went with orders. The cashier walked by at one point and said let me check on your burger. Finally the delivery man walked by almost a half hour later and said \"your burger is being flipped now\" and walked out to deliver an order. I didn't get my order until 6:16 pm and would have appreciated if they were honest at first and said the order was never started. I understand this is a difficult time but they did not seem busy.

We watched a short video and when it came time to rent the guns, we were helped by the club owner, Tim Miles. He completely took care of us knowing that it was our first time... and on top of that gave us a big discount on the gun rentals. \n\nJerry brought us out to the fields and basically taught us how to shoot a gun and then guided us on a complete introduction to the sport of trap and skeet. He coached us so well that we both shot quite a few birds throughout the day despite being beginners. \n\nHe then gave us a tour of the facility and also took us out to the sporting clay fields and introduced us to that as well. It really felt like we were hanging out with family. Jerry was super awesome  to us - if you're a beginner and need some guidance I very highly recommend him. He was very patient, kind, and knowledgable. Both Tim and Jerry gave us names, websites, and recommendations of where to continue the sport after we returned to our hometowns. They really went above and beyond. \n\nThe facility itself was well maintained and very easy to use. It was my first time shooting clays so I don't have much to compare it to but I thought it seemed massive (it can accommodate over 200 RVs) and I do know that they hold a lot of competitions there and have held the selection for the Olympics there. \n\nIf you're an avid shooter you probably already know of this facility and how the whole process works... but as a beginner, we weren't sure and their website wasn't very clear at explaining it for someone that was completely new (it is aimed more at seasoned shooters). Basically if you just show up during their office hours they will be able to help you. I will definitely be returning the next time I'm in the area!"

                "text": "Why is there only one review on here so far and only a week away?  Is this place really that new?  \n\nI wanted to try this place because:\n\n1. I saw the Peruvian food sign\n2.  They are trying to sell Peruvian food under the name \". . . New York Deli\"\n3.  Just by the first time, I was guessing it might be a gem since it's in such an unassuming place.\n4.  It's as if the previous? owners used the same name, but had a typical sandwich/hoagie joint.\n5.  nearby Inka Wall in Upper Darby was a Peruvian restaurant with bar and even a stage and a Peruvian shop, and it closed permanently\n6.  When I was headed on my way there on the first visit, I got State Rd. mixed up with Garrett Rd. as I wanted to go by my geographic \"memory\".  So, once I realized I messed up, maybe a dash of \"FOMO\", and because an order was already put in, then of course I re-directed myself to the right place.\n\nI technically made 3 trips to this place with 2 intended.\nThe first visit, they didn't have the alfajores arrive yet.  I picked up my noodles, a flan, and this purple chicha drink which reminded me of a purple drink I had when I was in Peru.  It was similar here but in a bottle and it was made of maize or corn, which I knew was comparable to what I had in Peru.\n\nThen, I re-visited the place at night for the alfajore (cookie with peanut butter in-between).  I liked the alfajore, but I would've preferred a raspberry or blueberry filling, but maybe that would be americanizing it too much.  Kind of like how I get slightly perturbed when people rave to me about philly steak sushi is one of the greatest sushis they've ever had with that implied unawareness that they don't know how to appreciate what else is really out there, lol.\n\nOn another day, I was craving for more.  So I ordered, not 1, but 2 entrees (lol)- fried fish fillets with fried rice  and also steak with egg, rice, and fried plantains.  It took me 4 meals to finish everything.  I don't remember which item came with a side salad.  On this visit, they had their drink machines running.  I'm guessing they do this only on the weekends and maybe Friday.  They had a brown colored drink, a white drink, and a purple drink that they told me is not the same as the chicha in a bottle.  I liked all of them and they let me sample all of them too.  I wanted to go with all three of them, but I figured I'd just keep it at one for now, lol.\n\nThe prior reviewer mentioned how there is a heavy Asian influence on Peruvian food, which makes sense.  There was a time when a significant number of Japanese immigrated to Peru.  In certain communities, the population of Japanese is about 33% of the entire community I believe.  There was also a wave of Chinese immigrants later on after that.\n\nThere are only five reviews of this place on GrubHub and since August 27. So, this change or place must be recent- like within a month or two.\nLook like the chicken might be too dry- that is something I didn't have from this place."

It was Ukrainian Christmas, and I needed to pick up something delicious on my way home.  I didn't want to drive to my usual place on the north end and remembered hearing about Purple Perogy!  Actually... I had tried something from their food truck in the summer and was impressed, but hadn't had a full meal from the restaurant yet.\n\nI called in an order because I assumed that they would be crazy busy.  I *LOVE* their combo plate and love that I don't have to make any decisions.  It comes with a little bit of everything... perogies, nalysnyky, pedishke, cabbage roll, garlic sausage, and meatballs.  I would say that the garlic sausage wasn't anything extraordinary but everything else was fantastic.  The meatballs really stood out to me... very tender and flavourful.  Pedishke is always my favourite and I absolutely loved these ones.  \n\nPrices are great and service is fantastic.  If I'm not mistaken, I believe it is run by a single family.\n\nEverything was really good AND it survived the 25 minute drive home without getting terribly soggy.  I'll definitely be back."

It's not the cleanest place. There are a lot a lot a lot of unsupervised children running around, which isn't the fault of the Chuck-E-Cheese as much as it is the parents who aren't watching their kids. In fact, Chuck E Cheese's has a system in place to try to keep someone else from running off with your child. The pizza is mediocre.  A lot of the games are broken or outdated.  I'm not sure that the soda machine have water. They have some sort of zero calories Diet Water situation, but it definitely wasn't water. I found the staff to be courteous, and helpful. My son had a really good time. I guess that's really all you can ask for. So, in conclusion, if you're going to go to Chuck E Cheese's, you probably know already what you're getting yourself into.

But then, hell froze over, and the Koreans sold my beloved Wow Pop to Indians, turning a top-five joint into an unmentionable dump.\n\nSince then, I haven't really bought any Korean fried chicken, but my cravings are still there and stronger than ever. \n\nLast weekend, my wife and I ordered dinner from the Medium Rare Carnivore Club. I like their name, and I've heard good things, so I had a rare feeling of optimism. And when I saw a Korean fried chicken burger on their menu, I started to salivate like a zombie with a fresh brain in its hands.\n\nSadly, the drool wasn't worth it. The Carnivore Club's Korean fried chicken burger is a gimmicky, uninspired turd. \n\nI doubt the chicken is fried twice like authentic Korean fried chicken - it lacks that trademark crispiness. And the thing is entirely dependent on just a little bit of sauce for its Korean flavour. I admit that the sauce somewhat mimics the sweet & spicy flavour I love. However, it's limited to a measly, bitch-ass splash on top of the lacklustre chicken, failing to cover the entire hunk of flesh.\n\nYou know, Backstairs Burger charges $14 and PrimeTime Donair charges $16 for their flagship burgers - my favourite burgers in Edmonton - but the Carnivore Club has the gall to demand a whopping $22 for a bottom-tier burger that fails to deliver what it promises. \n\nSure, the sauce is pretty decent, but calling this thing a Korean fried chicken burger is hyperbole and false advertisement. It's on par with me adding a little Safeway-bought butter chicken sauce to a McChicken, calling that crap a butter chicken burger, and peddling it for $22. That would be dishonest and stupid, and these adjectives sum up exactly how I feel about the Medium Rare Carnivore Club.\n\nMy Rating: 1.95/5"

This is a paleta shop, gourmet mexican ice cream on a stick with the refreshing creaminess that makes me think of gelato. Like its last two predecessors, the paleta bar also offers toppings and drizzles to customize your treat. They offer several choices for cream flavors, and between that and the toppings the choices are ENDLESS. But I zoned in on my classic go to faves. I went for a coffee flavored paleta with dark chocolate coating, pecans, chocolate with caramel drizzle. It hit the spot on a sweltering hot day. The ice cream itself was creamy and smooth, yet had a good bite to it, and didn't leave me with a messy mouth. It paired well with the dark chocolate shell and crunchy pecans, so I had a good variety of flavors and textures to contemplate as i enjoyed my treat. The worker behind the counter was very nice and had alot of energy as he explained everything they have to offer. If paletas are not your thang, they can make a milkshake out if any treat, but I do recommend trying the paleta first."

Once you pick a flavor you then have the option to dip in either milk, white, or dark chocolate. You then can choose to coat the chocolate with a topping like sprinkles, nuts, fruity pebbles, etc.\n\nBoth of ours were dipped in milk chocolate and then coated with sprinkles. My toddlers enjoyed every bite.\n\nI also ordered two drinks. One drink was more creamy/smoothie like and mixed with strawberry and mango. The other drink wasn't creamy and was a mix of blueberry and lime. It was so refreshing and had real blueberries. Both drinks were delicious. \n\n*There are no sugar-free options for the bars. \n\nI would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a fruity treat and/or refreshing drink."

They have a cute little popsicle selection that greets you right at the door. I am a fan, but knowing my clumsy self and the traffic across the bridge, I needed something more stable that would survive the car ride. \n\nIt was a hot day for December so I decided to opt for their horchata. I read some reviews and saw pictures of a fun horchata/coffee blend... I absolutely loved \"dirty horchata lattes\" from this one shop in Cali so my mind was set on that. \n\nUnfortunately, my new friend behind the counter informed me that they didn't serve coffee anymore, but offered me a small sample to try the horchata. I'm not gonna lie, I was a bit disappointed BUT the horchata tasted pretty good on its own... Creamy with a kick of cinnamon. I made sure I saved half a cup til I got home and made my own coffee to add and mix in. This combo is so good! Highly recommend adding the coffee horchata back to the menu if you can!"

If I wanted fake Chinese food, I would have ordered from Panda Express. Even that would be have been a thousand times better than what we got here. The chicken teriyaki and orange chicken bowls were terrible- they were just bowls of rice topped with a mush like substance that tasted of teriyaki and orange but there was no really discernible vegetable or chicken-- almost like it was all grounded up and blended into a thick sticky sauce. The baos were awful- hard dry stale buns with the same kind of filling- super ground/minced meats in a sweet mush sauce that you could not discern any meat in the filling at all. Almost like a paste filling. The dumplings were equally a disaster and tasted of freezer burn and cardboard. I ordered through Postmates and gave them the whole run down of how this place is not even a real restaurant and just a scam and received a full refund ($66!!).

Very similar ingredients to a kao soi but no crunchy rice noodles and a thinner, \"soupier\" broth. Reminded me of consistency of a Tom kha soup. It was exceptional. The pad ka prao is sliced meat here but they made it thai style by request by mincing meat. The entree comes with side of jasmine rice topped with fried egg. The stir fry was good, not overly sweet or overly basil flavored. It is in the middle of pack as far as this particular dish goes around indy metro.

There were literally only 4, maybe 5 tables that were occupied...it took longer than it should have just to put a drink order in. Then we ordered wings as an apetizer and specifically asked if they can be brought our before our meals...well the wings came out with our burgers.....we never were asked blue cheese or ranch and the wings didn't have either....we never were asked if we wanted ketchup or condiments....the burgers were warm at best and we're very bland....back to the wings....they gave us garlic parmessian when we ordered honey bbq.....we got the correct wings when it was time to go....took our waitress forever to get a to go box, mind you the place still had a handful of tables occupied....the waitress would just disappear at times and it would be a while before you saw her.....the wings actually had good flavor....but over all expierence was poor and at this point we will not be going back.....we eat out a lot and use yelp to give our true honest opinions about our expierences...very disappointed overall."

I couldn't be happier because I will pass this location several times during the week/weekend!\n\nWe stopped by during their Grand Opening Weekend and were greeted right away by one of the owners (who actually has been a friend of mine for over 25 years LOL). The restaurant was in pristine condition as G & B ALWAYS keeps their locations. \n\nI am a creature of habit, so I started with the Grain & Berry Bowl and Everything Avocado Toast plus a Poached Egg. B had the Relax Eat Repeat Bowl. Everything was amazingly delicious (as always) and consisted of the freshest ingredients. \n\nWe were treated to some Wheatgrass and Ginger shots and they were tasty, as well. If I could have someone make me these Wheatgrass shots every morning, they would certainly start my day off right! \n\nThe staff was very friendly and there is lots of parking behind the shopping plaza G & B is located in. \n\nDon't forget to add the app for reward points and to order ahead when you are in a hurry! \n\nThanks to Brendon and the Grain & Berry staff for a great experience!

The restaurant has the vibe of a chill Starbucks scene with the offerings of an A\u00e7a\u00ed Bowl/Smoothie Shop and more! Upon arriving to the location there is ample parking behind the store front. Outdoor seating is available with plenty of bike racks to park your emissions free ride. \n\nInside the decor and atmosphere is vibrant, colorful and cozy. Beauty wood paneling and bright lighting makes it warm and inviting. High top and low top seating is available for your preferred comfort. The menu is presented on large digital panels and is easy to read. The staff consists of what loos like eager college students who are ready to be of service. \n\nThe first time I went, I built my own a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl. Seeking to avoid gluten, I asked if the granola was gluten free. The young man was helpful but was unsure. Luckily, the owner was around to help to provide clarity on the gluten free options. Staff knowledge on gluten-free (allergen) items/ingredients is a growth area but does not\n ruin the experience. Perhaps they can add the GF, D, S letter by menu items on the panel to save on time or questions. \n\nAfter receiving my bowl, I was very happy with the presentation. I did end up going back for more shredded coconut and almonds, but that's just my preference. When I asked for more toppings and offered payment, the staff was very helpful and offered them in a closed ramekin for free. Lovely gesture! \n\nOverall, this is a lovely spot for those non coffee drinkers who'd like to get some work done, have a healthy meal, and get out of the house.  The prices of most items average about $10-$12 with out tax and tip. AND always remember to tip because all of the staff is making everything by hand. With gloves and masks on of course! \n\nI encourage everyone to make this apart of the spots you frequently visit. It is worth it and a refreshing break from a coffee shop."

A\u00e7a\u00ed bowls are some of my favorite things to get when I travel and always looking for new combos/appearances of them. Well, the big glass bowl is comes in for starters was enough to sell me with how cool that is! \n\nThe service was great, very friendly and bowls were fast. What I loved about the a\u00e7a\u00ed was it was more pur\u00e9ed and not like ice. I hate when a\u00e7a\u00ed places have icing a\u00e7a\u00ed and is so annoying to eat!

Had there not been a new menu in front of me, I would have just assumed I was at Ruby Tuesday. Like seriously, they didn't even tear the sign down. \n\nSecondly- the food was just bland. I ordered the BBQ chicken flatbread & could only taste the BBQ sauce. The chicken by itself was dry & the cheese was tasteless. My family ordered the chicken quesadilla & had a visceral reaction to the apparently overwhelming taste of the rice. By far the best part of my meal were my French fries. \n\nThirdly- I watched 2 employees have a 15 min conversation with customers without masks on. We visited in December, as COVID cases were on the upswing in our area & it just felt super irresponsible for the employees to be conducting this conversation when our region is under a mask mandate. \n\nHonestly, the only reason this review is 2 stars & not 1 is because our server was very nice & great at answering my menu questions. I understand they are a new establishment, but I do believe they need some work in the kitchen, as well as some adherence to current COVID policies."

Not good at all. 0 stars. \n\nThe bao were pretty good, though... which is the only reason that they got 2 stars. I would definitely order those again. I get the feeling that bao is the specialty of this place, and then they added on some crappy bowls for flair. They're definitely an afterthought. Again, not good.

Couldn't have replaced it with one of the bao that actually taste good either? Someone just had the bright idea that I would be ok with my DESSERT being replaced with VEGETABLES. I have never spit anything out faster. And like, I ordered the cheeseburger bao and those were really good! Couldn't have used those as a replacement instead?

What was less-than-impressive for me, and many others on this page, were the bowls. \n\nWhen we opened up our order, it looked like they just gave us this tiny cup of just rice? The meat mixture was a tiny scoop on the side of the bowl so you couldn't even see it at first and it was pretty disappointing... especially when all the pics corporate shows are these beautiful loaded bowls with all kinds of green onions and veggies on top. After mixing it in the rice to meat ratio was too great, and you'd just get bites of plain rice... Which was disappointing because the meat stews were all super flavorful! I got the chicken teriyaki and my husband got the spicy kung pao. For $15, it just wasn't worth it to me at all.\n\nThe Bao were large and fluffy, and I liked that they came with the paper on the bottom to list what flavor they were since my husband and I ordered different ones. But we both loved the spicy mongolian beef and the chicken teriyaki bao. The BBQ Berkshire pork was okay, but we preferred the flavors on the other! This is my first time trying Bao, and all the dough was interesting to me... Maybe a little dry? I'll definitely have to find a local, non-chain bao place to try and update how they really compare!\n\nAs for the potstickers, they were a teensy tiny bit overcooked, but the filling was good and they were delicious...

So a bun filled with meat? Perfectly delicious! I love how easy these are to eat. I wanted to stuff my face with a whole bunch of them. I managed to eat 3 and I was stuffed. I ordered the 6 pack of bao and a 12 pack of dumplings. I got one of each of the meat dumplings (they have a veggie option too). Pork bbq, Mongolian beef and chicken teriyaki. Of the 3 flavors, I ended up liking the chicken the best. These would be great for a quick lunch. They're easy to eat with your hands, so great if you have to grab food on the go and eat in the car or while walking around. I imagine they'd be a fun and clean meal for kids to eat too. The dumplings were also very good. They didn't come with a sauce like I often see with dumplings, but these were fine on their own. I also ate them with my hands, but they do have oil on them, so not as meat as the bao. Overall, I really liked this place."

I had  close brush with a couple of them who just showed up to stock the bins and one even just with his bare hands moved my cart away.\nI know the ladies up front are wearing at the cash register are wearing mask and gloves. By letting a bunch of employees work without adequate PPE they are doing a disservice to their employees and customers for sure.\nAlso for a large grocery store they can provide goodwill by providing cart wipes or some spray disinfectant to clean.\nI hope they will pay heed to these business improving tips , especially if they want to stand out among their competitors rather than  focusing on cost cutting measures.\n."

For fresh veggies I 100% recommend going to Patel brothers, but this place is not bad.  I did notice a lot of fleas around the potatoes and onions on two consecutive trips, so now I just avoid buying any veggies from there. It is mainly the packaged foods, rice, flour, and other bulk stable indian foods I get from them.\n\nPrices are fantastic too. I actually think they're cheaper than Patel.

The produce selection was very fresh and reasonably priced, best okra I've ever seen. The halal meat section was more butcher counter style, mostly cut to order with a few selections precut in the cooler shelves. My two pet peeves was there were a few items on promo sale which didn't ring properly (I didn't notice it until after I looked over my receipt) and the cashier was very slow bc she advised the register wasn't ringing my items up. She had to hand input in a lot of my items. Kinks I really hope they work out since I don't like to be misled by sales. \n\nThe to-go food side was spacious and looked clean, a mix of modern style booths and tables, ample seating for both large groups and singles. There's also a hand washing station with 2 sinks. The walk up food counter was a bit more chaotic, no designated line so there was people gathering on both the left and right sides leading to the single cash register at the center making it difficult to social distance.They have a deli style prepared hot food selection, a dessert counter and a little bakery area. On the weekends they offer different specials, this weekend it was 3 varieties of biryanis. \n\nI ordered food to go which included 2 apps from the hot food selection, a chicken curry combo ($7.99 for main entree, white rice, 2 pieces whole wheat rotis and a lentil soup), a lamb biryanis, and the Gobi 65 (a spicy Indo-Chinese battered cauliflower dish). Total came out to $45, good amount for 2 people. I was told it would take 15 mins for the biryanis special and Gobi 65 which I understood. It took them 40 mins to make the special; at the 30 mins mark I went up to the counter for an update and was told it would be 5 more mins. When I went up to the counter a 2nd time, I was rudely shooed way. I'm very patient to hospitality staff but that was the final straw for me. I was ready to ask for my money back for the last 2 items and leave with what I had when my order was finally done. I was hurriedly given the rest of my food. Customer service was extremely lacking. My food was good but not great. Surprisingly the hot counter food was better than the specials! Rice in biryanis overcooked but at least lamb was delicious and well spiced. Gobi 65 had good flavor but was a disaster! The tiny container they stuffed it into made the batter turn mushy. This is a dish where they batter and fry the cauliflower then toss it in a sauce so why they would sabotage it like that is besides me! \n\nIf you plan on getting hot food here, call ahead or order the prepared hot deli selection. Otherwise, prepare to wait. Staff is not very friendly or helpful in giving descriptions. I just googled menu items I wasn't familiar with while waiting for my turn in line."

It has a cafe where they serves snacks and full meals along with certain breads/baked goods.\n\nUnlike Patel Bros, you can actually walk in the aisles without walking sideways. The aisles are well labeled. It has many of the same brands and items as Patel though there are some different ones here and there.\n\nOne product I would recommend is Tea India's  Massala Chai tea. It is around $6 and has 72 tea bags. It is in a red square box. (Just use two tea bags and microwave for 2.5 minutes if you have a 1100Watt microwave. Then add sugar/cream.

Also, the floors weren't the cleanest (ex. dry food items spilled in aisles & no one performing a clean up), & there were too many stock boxes lying around because shelves were being stocked during business hours-- although the boxes were at times lying empty in aisles not currently being stocked.\n\nTo this Indian grocery novice, prices appeared VERY GOOD!  A BIG KUDOS goes out to stocker \"Reddy,\" who took at least 10 min to show me what spices I'll need in order to cook most Indian dishes, where to find them, & how to use them. Truly an EXCELLENT representative of this Indian grocery! Thanks to him, I bought much more than I had originally intended, & I'm more likely to return. (I only went in to browse after shopping next door & spotting this market.)\n\nLocated in Market Square in Tampa Palms beside Petsmart, this grocery is open daily from 10 AM till 9 PM; however, the Cafe is closed on Mondays. Its hours are 11:30 AM till 9 PM Tuesday thru Sunday. \n\nIn this market,  you'll find fresh fruits & vegetables; halal meat; bakery items made on site; buriyani; appetizers; frozen foods; grocery items; many grains, spices (SO many) & sauces; & just about anything an Indian family might want from a grocery store...including lots & lots of rices & incense:) \n\nThis is a decent-sized grocery that has wide aisles & a high ceiling. It reminded me of a small Costco or Sam's Club. There was a nice selection of fresh produce too well hidden in the back behind tall freezer cases (where you'll find the frozen Naan/Nan). The cold section is to the far right. The Cafe with tables & a large TV is located on the far left (see pic). Each aisle in this store is marked w/ an overhead sign; the food items appear to be decently organized. \n\nCheck out is easy. There are two old registers behind plexiglass; however, the registers appear rather new... & quite nice-- each grocery item rung up by the cashier appears in bold print on the screen so customers can easily see how much they're being charged. (See pic.) Your items will be bagged in small yellow plastic bags. \n\nThank you, Taaza Mart management, for a good variety of food items, for the great prices, & for \"Reddy\"! I shall return...& return to tell \"Reddy\" how my Chicken Korma & other homemade Indian dishes fared!"

The selections we have ordered: coconut shrimp, pizza, burger, and the shrimp pasta. Everything has been delicious! The pizza is very thin, so it wasn't my favorite, but the flavors were excellent. The pizza would be better suited for people who prefer it to be very thin. I absolutely love their shrimp pasta with the fresh tomatoes and sauce. My husband loves their burger and you can't beat the price for the size of the burger, and the included side. The coconut shrimp and sauce were also cooked to perfection; the sauce was sweet and flavorful as well. The menu is eclectic with an array of modern and European cuisine. We will definitely be stopping in to the restaurant one day to fully enjoy all it has to offer, but are excited to have a nice bistro close to home!"

They said 20 mins and the pizza was cold when I picked it up. They didn't even put all the toppings I asked for and got the order wrong after charging $1.50per toppings. This is not a place that takes pride in the food they are serving but just in it to charge premium prices for less than mediocre pizza. Also got to-go drinks and more than half the cup was filled with ice. I will never go back and if you are looking for gluten free pizza or a place that values customers and the food they serve do NOT go here. This is by far the worst pizza I've gotten in the area.

We were excited to try this place & my husband loves pizza and I  to support our local small businesses and we are glad we did. Started with the steak flatbread and the flavor was great. The crust was perfectly crisp and thin to my liking, yes!! On this pizza they topped it with a drizzle of avocado sauce and I really like it, nice touch.  My hubby got a custom pizza Pepperoni, mushroom and onion, again great flavor with a base red sauce. The crust was perfect and they serve on each table crushed red peppers we both loved that. The owners husband & wife were wonderful. We welcome them, wish them success and they were happy to meet & greet their new customers. You can eat in at a table or the bar area to experience their craft beers and other alcohol selections or take outs or delivery. Nicely decorated and be sure to read on the wall behind the bar how they came up with their name \"Calusa\" Pizza & Craft, it's interesting.

My wife's burrito was cold in the middle. The food had a good flavor but that's where it ends. \n\nThere's a lot better places to go with much better service!!"

In all honesty, the food is average and not sure they stand out from the crowded field.\nChips were very thick and salsa was probably a bit too spicy for the average person. The server (one of the brothers) was very friendly. The inside has undergone a drastic renovation from previous restaurant iterations and looks very charming. My 12 oz steak seemed a bit small for 12 oz and was dry. Rice really needed something ( a dose of salsa helped) and the salad also Needed more flavor - remedied with a dollop of sour cream scooped from my wife's salad.\nFinal verdict: nice ambiance, average Tex-Mex fare."

I worked in the restaurant business for over 10 years in almost every capacity so I know the business well and have been overly sympathetic to the industry over the past 18+ months, always patronizing local and tipping overly well. While I understand lack of staffing it does not excuse incompetence and basic training. We've had a range of experiences here from untrained servers, the funniest was one who didn't know what unsweetened iced tea was. BUT it's 5 mins from my in-laws home and we were celebrating 3 birthdays at their home last night so I placed a large order online ($170+) at 10:45am for 5:15pm pickup thinking that would be enough time for them to get it together. Picked up, brought it home and we were missing an item. Deep breath. Called, not an immediate apology but an excuse as to what went wrong. Drove back, waited and then was brought it out with a flippant 'sorry about that', like I didn't have people at the house and this wasn't an inconvenience. At minimum the item should have immediately been refunded, but the least I expected was someone to take accountability. We're done looking beyond the constant shortfalls."

Made a reservation thru open table for 5:45 and arrived just a bit earlier and was greeted and seated right away. The spot itself is in an interesting location, as there are townhomes just behind and many open retails spaces nearby, so just when you feel you are in the wrong spot, you see all the people and the restaurant itself.\nQuite spacious with an outside seating area out front and some space out back too. Not sure they are seating parties out back. Will investigate on my next visit.\nOur server was sweet but couldn't quite answer our questions regarding the \"boardroom spirits\" off of the HH menu, so she talked to the GM and came back to let us know it was simple drinks using Rum, Gin or Vodka. I would have loved an inexpensive whisky on the menu, but settled on a rum and coke and my wife had a rum and ginger beer. It was nice she could get the ginger beer too and not a ginger ale. \nSince there were things to order for food off the happy hour menu too, I put in an order for onion rings and the angry mussels. \nOnions rings showed up after a few minutes and it was a stacker of 6-7 rings. Thick cut onions and super flaky batter which would fall off at the slightest touch, but delish. They were served with a marinara and a spicy pesto sauce that was fantastic. Soon after, the mussels arrived and a good sized portion and 3pcs of bread to soak up the broth. Fresh mussels and great flavor. We were not full, so I was ready to order up a pizza, but the place filled up fast and our server was simply overwhelmed. It was 15 minutes before we had her back to our table and we didn't have the time to wait much longer and that food settled in our bellies, so we didn't leave hungry one bit.\nLooking forward to the next visit to get one or two pizzas and get a beer, as the tap list looked solid. This place can get busy, so show up early or make  your reservations."

It was advertised as large 16\" but you can bet it was much smaller.  The pizza came within 5-6 minutes of the order which is suspicious for a pre-made mediocre bar pizza.  And sadly it was pasty and flavorless, much along the line of frozen supermarket pizza.  There are much better pizza places from Exton to Elverson. This, for now, is a hard pass.  Maybe they will pick up their game and improve the quality and value to customers.  On a positive note the wait staff was attentive and friendly."

Again service was on point and friendly.\nBut have too say they changed the Caesar salad I raved about last week from what I would say was a loaded Caesar to a regular Caesar. The egg, charred broccoli , bacon, and Avocado were now gone. It was still a good Caesar and a small  with a sled of calamari  made a great meal. Truly hope the loaded Caesar returns to the menu( server told us a lot of people were asking about it). My daughter was in for her first trip and had the small salad topped with grilled shrimp and was very impressed as she said shrimp were perfect. Wife got salad with a side of meatballs and had one and took other 2 home and was ecstatic as she said meatballs were closest she had had in a restraint to her Italian born aunts homemade . A side note that should be mentioned..,for anyone with tree nut/ peanut allergies.. was well documented by server and manger came out to assure us nothing on menu to worry about but dessert and that that is kept in totally different prep and storage area . So no chance of cross contamination and that she personally had staff change gloves and wash hands as extra precaution ... needless to say from someone who has been to the ER a couple of times with my child due to nut cross contamination that made the meal a lot more enjoyable and comfortable as in our family it is truly a life and death issue . These days it is a most welcome relief. Looking forward to many more great meals and happy times at this new much needed community establishment."

I ordered \"large\", but I think their pizzas are one-size, and they are definitely NOT large.  I would call this a medium pizza, and they were not enough for the amount of people I was feeding.

Other than being overcharged, the pizza has been extremely soggy in the middle, making it very difficult to eat, and the new crinkle cut fries are nowhere near as good as the hand cut fries they used to serve. Finally, on our last visit there last week for a birthday celebration, one of us in the group got mussels which came out around 20 minutes after everything else, and that was after asking about them multiple times. They did comp the mussels, which was very nice of them, but I can't remember being at a restaurant in the past where the timing was so off. I will be going back soon to try the new garlic knots.

Next up was the meatball sub.my wife is a meatball aficionado and gave these a top rating . While I'm not normally a meatball sub guy was impressed and would order again. Next up was the watermelon habanero chicken wings which were large enough for two to share had a sweet slight hit of heat .. the blue cheese dressing was excellent (hint order two).

One of my favorite hobbies is trying out new restaurants. Since they are closed on Mondays I had to wait until lunch today. I was absolutely floored with the experience.\n\nUpon entering you are greeted with a cafeteria like setup. The staff here were fantastic and seemed genuinely excited when I told them it was my first time here. They had me try many of the entrees on the menu and everything I had was delicious. I settled on the Plato Especial, which is two entrees and two side items. For my sides I did beans and rice. For my entrees I chose Birria and Cochinita Pibil. The Birria they have here is beef instead of goat which is what I was expecting however it was still fantastic. The Cochinita Pibil was also wonderful, perfectly seasoned. The rice and beans were also fantastic. I had flour tortillas with my meal and ate about half of the meat by itself and the other half folded into tacos.\n\nThe man behind the counter also gave me a small side of chips and salsa to sample. I enjoyed the taste of the salsa; however, I prefer spicier salsa.\nI ordered Jamaica (hibiscus tea), for my drink and was very happy with it. The flavor was much stronger than I am used to however I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe entire establishment looked very clean and multiple employees stopped by my table to make sure everything was good. These employees really try their best to make you feel welcome and I appreciate that.\n\nMy only complaint would be that everything I had was very mild. The flavor was there however I wish there was a bit of a burn on my tongue. I am not going to deduct for that though as the flavor was fantastic and next time I come I will just bring some hot sauce with me or ask if they have any."

It was overpriced along with the wait we had; it was not worth it at all. We were told 15-20 minutes, but it took more like 30-45 and several more people after me were told the same thing both in person and over the phone. Service was standoffish but I understand they were super busy and working hard to accommodate the number of orders they had. The dough looked frozen/hard/stiff, as if it was just taken out of the cooler plopped with some sauce and ingredients then thrown on the rotator belt to cook. It was super greasy with no flavor and didn't have a great smell either because of all the grease. I recommend getting food earlier from somewhere else."

They charged us 500 on our card right before Christmas and we have 5 kids. They refused to give us our money back. My husband had to go over in person at midnight to the casino to try to get our money back so we can get the money we had set aside for Christmas gifts for our children back. Let me stress also that we never received our 150 deposit back either. This place is a fraud and they took money away illegally from two innocent people. Horrible. Please please ban this place!"

I prefer thin crust pizza and that's what we got here. We have tried the Cleopatra Jones,The Pep and today we tried the The Dude. So far The Cleopatra Jones has been our favorite. They sale by slice or whole pizzas.  Everyone there has been friendly. I highly recommend trying them out. You can order online and pick it up or have it delivered or even eat in.

My favorites are the classics - plain cheese and pepperoni. But Greg have lots of options - including vegetarian and vegan! I haven't seen Ms. Kitty on the Smyrna menu yet, but if you see it, get it! It's topped with Hattie's hot chicken, what! You can also order whole pies, for delivery or pickup! There's plenty of seats inside and even patio. All employees were wearing masks. Prices are fair and so is service! The only reason for the -.5 star is for grit garlic knots, which were hard and burntish. I prefer mine soft and pillowy.

Met Row (short for Rowena) and she explained to me all of the options available. Love the fact they sell a number of different slices so I decided to try a slice of cheese and a slice of The Newman. The cheese was good and the sauce on the slice was semi-sweet with a solid tomato flavor. Nice amount of cheese complimented the slice so you could enjoy all of the flavors. For a slice of plain old cheese...really good with a nice crispy crust. The Newman slice is their \"classic white\" meaning no tomato sauce, just cheese with Sopressata and Sweet Italian Sausage. This slice of pizza was exceptional...all of the flavors clicked on this one and the lack of tomato sauce wasn't missed at all. What impressed me most was the crust on both slices. It had a really nice flavor, crispy, with a tinge of sweetness to it...one of the better crusts I have had in a long time and it was easy to \"fold\" when eating. I asked Row if there was a special ingredient and she told me corn meal...WOW!!! \n\nOverall...really good pizza, some interesting topping options (Italian versus Creole), good pricing for a large slice, and great service."

It was a little disorienting walking into the old Pie Five location, to begin with.  On the drive home, I decided to try a slice.  Not only did my 45 minute drive home seem to take 10 minutes, but I accidentally ate half a pizza and *almost* got caught in a speed trap due to my being so caught up in the flavor. I even caught myself saying audibly (and apparently to myself), \"What IS this MEAT?!\" \n\nI'm not cultured.  I think I had some creole chicken and pepperoni on one and sopressata, tasso, and andouille something-or-other on the other. I don't mean to sound cliche', but my experience was other-worldy. Be careful when eating and driving!  I recommend enjoying at home or in restaurant with the company of others. \n\nIn addition, I ordered a couple of pizzas that are not currently on their menu, but were on the menu at another location (because I was looking at the wrong thing, I guess).  Even so, they still made them. \n\nI'm not sure if the owner was at this location due to it having just opened or not, but the staff seemed more like young business-men than your typical staff. They were amazingly cordial and acted like they had a stake in the restaurant's success.  In conclusion, and all jokes aside, best pizza I've ever had. I DEFINITELY recommend Two Boots (not one)."

It has fresh quality ingredients such as organic fresh spinach, roasted garlic, roasted peppers, red onion & marinara sauce. I think it's suppose to come with mushrooms also but didn't see any. This didn't take away from the pizza. It had generous amount of toppings. The sauce has a tiny kick to it, but not overpowering spicy. I also swapped out the vegan cheese for mozzarella cheese.  Second item ordered was a calzone called CBGB. It was supper delicious, I left out the chicken and it couldn't be any better. Haven't had a good calzone in years. It will filled with lots of broccoli and it was spilling out of the sides. Lastly the garlic knots were the best, super soft and doughy on the inside with a good stretch. They were huge!

I also tried some mac and cheese omg that was sooo tasty- I think next time i will get the Shrimp and grits meal mmmm or even BBQ short ribs and some mac and cheese - they were sold out of the BBQ short ribs that night!  for dessert we got homemade cheesecake that was delicious!! Also coffee which had a great flavor and super hot!"

I walk inside with my son and no one greets us. I have to announce myself and why I'm there. I tell them the name for the order. The staff says they're going to check on my order. The staff come back out and do not update me on the status of my food. So I asked, is my food ready or will I have to wait some more. I was told it's coming right out. About 10 minutes pass by and I take my son back to sit in the car with my sister because he's getting antsy. I go back inside and ask again about the status of my food. The owner then says to me \"I was here when you walked in and you came in like (hand gesture) that\". He was condescending. He was saying I had an attitude when I was just coming in and asking about my order instead of being told about it when I called in. Questions, that staff should be able to answer.  I said \"sir I called you at 2:45. I was just expecting my food to be ready.\" Then instead of apologizing for the wait he tells me that this is a restaurant and we get 100s of orders. (You're a restaurant. Getting orders is what you're supposed to do). He then says \"you would have to wait at Chik Fil A\". I said \"ok sir\". Then he says \"I see you want to get the last word\".....I was not at Chik Fil A. I am at YOUR establishment. I don't care about how many orders you have. No acknowledgment of my wait or frustration. Before leaving I HAD TO REQUEST utensils. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS KEY AND THIS ESTABLISHMENT HAS NONE. I have no problem waiting for food when it's addressed early on and communicated clearly. However, when you are spending your hard earned money you're paying for an experience. I will not be back, plus my fish was cold."

You can also tell they use previously frozen salmon which is strange. I wouldn't recommend this place for soul food maybe for some other food but I can't attest to that."

The pizza menu here has been totally revamped by a local guy named John who gets his flour, cheese, and other ingredients from local farmers. The freshness of the ingredients totally comes out in the pizza. I never tried the pizza here before John came in but I know that pizza is a genuine passion for John since he was a NJ/NY native!\nThe pizza is very thin crust like what you would find in old school authentic pizzerias in NY, baked on a gas-fire oven, and doesn't sit in the oven long before getting a perfectly balanced and charred crust.\nI got the classic Margherita as well as the Pesto Shrimp. They were both super simple pizzas but very well executed. I seriously can't believe that pizzas of this quality are being made in a somewhat obscure restaurant in the Wyncote/Glenside area. Please check it out and support local restaurants!"

The food is amazing, however it is never hot when served. The servers are friendly, but not attentive(even before the pandemic). They will disappear for long periods of time without checking on you. It was a hassle just to get a glass of water for each guest and eating utensils. There is also a $50 charge to bring an outside cake, however its a BYOB restaurant so you can bring alcohol which is great but seems more of a liability than a cake. Although the owner was very friendly in person, whoever is in charge of responding to emails for private events was not very helpful or seemed to not want to be bothered. I requested a phone call but was told email was the preferred method of contact. Overall, the guests enjoyed their food and the ambience."

You could taste the smoke on the jerk chicken and the perfect combination of spices. The stew chicken was fall off the bone and perfectly seasoned also. The sides were equally as delicious. Hands down some of the best mac and cheese. And the beef patties were flaky and scrumptious. Everything was reasonably priced. The woman at the restaurant was super sweet and nice. 1000% recommend.

Usually displays are attractively arranged to make me want to buy other food items, but not today. Boxes opened and unopened were strewn around, some with packaged food falling out, no displays, no organization, nothing to entice me to buy more. When I asked about sides or rolls she pointed to a picture on the counter and walked away. Employee said she didn't smell anything.  I have been in the back of butcher shops and meat markets and know the smell of rotting meat. It is normally kept separate away from fresh meat and customers to be disposed of in a sanitary manner.

I can't see the reasoning in this - so I'll just take my business and my (very) hard-earned money elsewhere.\n\nI was also told they were having an in-store promotion of buy one half, get another half at half price. Who needs the equivalent of a whole ham when we are NOT supposed to be gathering? I don't think this store gets it."

This time the ham looked weird, I took some pics of it & if we did not live 25mins south of here, I would've drove back & got a replacement or refund. My wife said the container was not sealed all the way so air got into the meat & turned it brownish, i thought at 1st it was the brown sugar they used but this had nothing to do with the brown sugar. Did not tasted the same either, took a shot of the potato salad & coleslaw as well, coleslaw seem a bit slimy & the potato salad seemed dry. Place seems to be older & a bit run down, not like the one in Clearwater that is newer & always busy. If yu come here, make sure to check yur meat before yu leave, there's no telling what it will look like."

(It has housed at least four different restaurants over the past 10 years.) We weren't sure what to expect when we visited the latest incarnation, Salty Shamrock, last night. \n\nWell, we were thoroughly impressed! First of all, they've redone the inside to expand the bar seating exponentially and extend it outside, which seemed particularly smart during our visit since it was a gorgeous evening. The new configuration will make the pub an outstanding venue for televised sports, and there are televisions distributed around the bar to make watching games convenient. They've also added a decent draft beer selection that includes ciders as well as local brews from Cigar City. Our bartender, Amy, crafted first-class cocktails and handled a large Saturday night crowd with humor, competence and aplomb. \n\nWe ordered food as well, and even my husband, who is an incredibly picky eater when it comes to fish, was impressed with the Salty Shamrock version of fish 'n chips. The dish featured nice, firm, thick white cod filets coated with a unique batter that may have included corn flakes and fried to crispy perfection. We also had a mushroom pizza and crab cakes, both of which were excellent. We found the prices reasonable and the service impeccable.\n\nApollo Beach has long needed an upscale pub offering a decent beer selection, excellent food and fast, friendly service, and now we have one. We wish the Salty Shamrock the very best of luck and will definitely be repeat customers."

Nice thick, fresh mozzarella, but they don't put sliced tomatoes on it. I hate tomatoes, so it's all good for me.\nThe crab cakes are so good! So good! They are made fresh and you can tell. The texture is like a pancake. Must be pan fried them as opposed to deep fried. The ratio of crab meat to breading is perfect too; you can really taste the crab. Comes with a tart and tasty fried green tomato all over remoulade. Definitely recommend.\nMy friends both had the fish n chips. It was a big delicious piece of fish instead of little frozen sticks you get most places. I tried a bit and it was great. The guys both devoured it. Served with a side of coleslaw, fries, and smashed peas. \nThe ambiance is a simple bar & grill with a fisherman's flare. There are mounted fish on the walls and dockside whatnots. It works for the proximity of the location to the bay. \nSamantha was our server and she was very friendly, helpful, and attentive."

The lobster soup is so creamy and thick and the tomato basil grilled cheese sandwich is sinfully good."

How can anyone go here and not have dessert, is beyond me? \n\nI hosted a small gathering of cousins for a Christmas dinner and one of my cousins brought two pies for dessert. She knew my favorite pie is Pecan, so it was one of them and the other was Lemon. She dropped them off at my house the day before Christmas. Having a freshly baked pecan pie in my house was a huge temptation. I had to use all my strength, I wanted a slice so bad. Christmas Day could not get here any faster. I wanted that pie. \n\nOnce we were done with dinner and our gift exchange, it was dessert time and you know what I wanted. I've enjoyed a lot slices of Pecan Pie in my day and I will say, this is one of the best if not the best I have eaten. Another one of cousins who attended our holiday dinner raved about the Lemon pie. \n\nIf their pie is this good, I cannot wait to go and experience their lunches. The cousin who brought the pies, is a semi-regular diner, so I will tagging along with her for a lunch in 2021. \n\nWhen: Christmas Day\nWhy: Dessert for holiday dinner"

Sauce is delicious and the ratio of sauce and cheese is perfect.  It's also a family owed joint and they are so friendly and welcoming.

Nevertheless, when my girlfriend, our kids, and I came in and ordered, the cook/owner shook his head at me while I was ordering, simply because it took us a while to place the order. What an asshole! Clearly he doesn't have kids, or understand that sometimes it takes a while for them to figure out what they want. Anyway, the food came out pretty quickly... the waitress that was working there was pretty quick, so I give her props.\n\nThe wrap I ordered was decent. Most of the rest of the food we ordered was average to poor quality. My girlfriend's son never got a slice of pizza that he ordered (the cook mistakenly gave it to another person who ordered after us). This wasn't really a problem, except for when it came time to pay...\n\nWhen I went up to pay, the cook told me the total. There was no bill, just a number he had written on a piece of paper. I asked to see the bill, and he told me his system was down. Never mind the fact that he wrote everything down when I ordered. Apparently it was too much trouble for him to write up a bill for me. I told him that my girlfriend's son never got the slice he ordered, and to subtract that from the bill. The cook acted like I was lying. He reluctantly subtracted the cost of the slice from the bill, but he kept muttering that he was sure he had given us the slice.\n\nThe final straw came when we were leaving. We had a couple plates of the kids' food that we wanted to take to go. I asked for some styrofoam containers and a bag to put them in. The waitress helped us out with that, but she gave me a paper bag to put them in, which was too small. I asked her for a plastic bag, and the cook said, \"We don't have any\"... which was a lie. There was a pack of plastic bags hanging up on a hook behind him. I had had enough of this guy at this point, so I turned and left the restaurant. However, my girlfriend stayed behind and told the cook, \"Sir, there are plastic bags hanging up behind you.\" The cook ignored my girlfriend and went back to whatever it was he was doing. Eventually the waitress came back over and gave her one.\n\nIf you ever find yourself over in this area (possibly because you're going to see a movie), and you think of eating at this restaurant, THINK AGAIN!!!"

Although I was not hungry yet and stopped in to check out their menu as I was in the neighborhood, I decided to order their $7.99 M-F lunch meal. The price was right. There is no space for eating so takeout is the only option.\n\nI chose the 3 whiting fish with crispy fries and a can of orange Fanta. I think I was the first customer for the day. My estimated wait seemed long, but I made good use of my time.\n\nThe fries were overflowing in the takeout container; they were crispy with salt on them. The whiting fish were scaly and delicious. I like the 12 oz. can of soda instead of a fountain drink as I saved some for another meal.\n\nMy suggestion to them to make things better was to get a frequent eater's card. They did not think of it but will consider it. I hope this family-owned, friendly business will be successful. It is where Hungry Howie's Pizza used to be located in Fishers, IN.\n\nI will definitely return.  I was also interested in the Philly cheesesteak.

But the curry, wow, and I usually don't even care for curry much. I'll be getting that again. We got the mac and cheese, callaloo, cabbage, and plantain sides. We liked them all but the mac and cheese and callaloo will be my go-to. Oh, and by the way, there are no leftovers and my picky eater kids liked several of the items. I'll be back for more, some other customers there suggested the oxtail stew and jerk pork which both sound great too. This place has a small menu, but they to do the dishes well. And I called late on a Saturday and they were out of a few things, which I actually appreciate because it makes me think their food is fresh."

The flavors of the Ackee and Salt Fish and plantains complemented each other wonderfully. I could eat this rice all day long! My husband loved his oxtail and cabbage. All he did was say, \"Mmmm mmmmm\" as he made his dinner disappear. We're excited to have more meals here!"

Well no more, Paradise Jamaican Cuisine delivered big time for me.  \n\nFrom the second I stepped foot in till walking out with my night's dinner was a perfect experience.  I was immediately greeted and helped.  Being my first time and not being familiar with their menu nor food preparations I had questions and they were nothing by kind and engaging in helping me.  After running through the menu items I asked them my favorite new restaurant question-- \"it's my first time, what would you recommend to ensure that I come back a second time.\"  This strategy has never let me down.\n\nI prefaced that I never had stew oxtails and was hesitant until the hostess, the owner's cousin offered me a sampling taste. [Smart strategy on her behalf)  Needless to say, that became my meal of choice and boy was I surprised by how good it was. Moist, tender, tasty, fresh and flavorful. The closest food analogy would be short ribs or pot roast, but 50x better. WOW!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nOn the side was a real tasty rice and bean mix accompanied by a side of their cooked to order fried plantains.  Yummy!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThey even snuck in two pieces of their finger linking jerk chicken, that was off the charts.  Moist meat on the bone with a pleasant jerk flavor. \n\nTalk about new comfort food and close to home at a very reasonable price point.\n\nThe establishment was super clean, welcoming, comfy high boy chairs and a ledge by the window for those wanting to dine on the premises.\n\nSee my scrumptious photos.\n\nWoo Hoo!

This winter they also started handing out small cups of hot complimentary soup.

(Unlike hotel ballrooms where you step out of your event into a fluorescent-lit hallway or lobby that smells like a swimming pool.) \n\nThe building was icebox cold to the point of discomfort. Even the men were commenting on how cold it was. When I asked if they could do something about that, I was told the room would warm up once everyone arrived. (It didn't.)\n\nWe had a catered buffet-style lunch. The vegetarian lasagna was extremely salty, but the salad was good (nice mix of greens with ripe tomatoes) and the homemade bread they brought from the kitchen was delicious. (The rolls offered with lunch had bacon in them, so I had to special request non-meat bread.) Everything on the buffet line was labeled, which is a rarity with many Idaho caterers and much appreciated by this vegetarian.\n\nThe attention to detail in terms of decor seems to have started strong, but may be slipping. I was surprised to see toilet cleaning supplies stored in plain sight in the otherwise opulent bathroom, and computer-printed signs scotch-taped to interior doors, walls and the front door. Nothing snaps you out of a luxurious experience and back to reality like scotch tape on a wall!\n\nIn summary: I would absolutely recommend this facility for a special event.

I'm not sure what the dishes were called, since there are no name plates, but one looked like mandarin chicken (MC), and the other was referred to as \"spicy\" chicken (SC.\n\nTo whatever credit they may deserve, the chow mein/lo mein (not sure) was actually better than your average fast food counterpart. Take that as you will."

The orange chicken has orange flavor, but is very subtle compared to Panda, it also lacks the crispiness that Panda's signature dish was known for. The Kung Pao was good, but very spicy for my tastes. I think overall, the food here is worth it as opposed to waiting for Panda Express and the increase in variety, but the food seems to be variable quality. Also, again, when using to pay, they have undisclosed credit card fees which is annoying. [I realized I have inaccurately rated the first time.]"

I would call this a better version of Panda Express. \nThe portion sizes are quite good and you can get a \"three plate\" for around $12. \nI'm still not sure what a three plate is vs. a two plate, but I think you should be able to get three sides with a three plate. You can get half/half rice and noodles as a main for each plate. \nI think this place has a better deal than the Panda Express on campus (UCen) but it's probably not worth coming to IV for lunch. \n\nFood:\nRice was kind of dry but I thought it was good. Chow mein-esque noodles were okay. \nOrange chicken was pretty good. Slightly sweet which I liked and the breading wasn't hollow like it can be. Overall worth the money considering it's IV. Price is around the same as Lao Wang and Panda. \n\nLast thing to note is that they only take cash and venmo, no credit card."

The idea is basically a copycat of Pronto Panda Express, with more authentic dishes and more vegetarian options. The prices are comparable to the UCEN Panda, but most notably there is not a 30 minute line to get food. As for the food itself, I liked the string beans and the chow mein, but could use seasoning adjustments. The pork was not cha siu, it was like dry pork soaked in chinese honey bbq sauce. Don't get this pork. However, the rest of the items look promising and the service was good, so would definitely be keen on returning. \n\nAlso, following up on the previous reviewer, they now do take credit card, but they have a subcharge that they did not disclose."

I ordered Brandon Burgers on UberEats because there was a BOGO special on several menu items. I decided to get the three piece chicken tenders which were BOGO and a medium fries. I waited for my food to arrive and LO and BEHOLD, it was really 4 tenders in each box. That's right 8 tenders total and a medium fry for $10?! It gets better. The fries were in a box in a SACK so they basically filled the bag of fries too. There was so much food I didn't know what to do with myself. The tenders were crispy and a decent size. They definitely had some edges with just straight crisp and no chicken so the 4 tenders balanced that. The French fries were hit and delicious. Nothing special but really can you mess up a golden fried potato stick? They provided a lot of sauces and ketchup. Lucky for me I have lunch tomorrow and I basically paid for nothing. Will definitely try more menu items later!"

                "text": "Upon my first visit to Brandon burgers my hopes were quite high based on many other reviews left here and on other sites. It would appear that from some of the early reviews compared to now this place may have gone downhill a little bit. The positives I noticed were strong teamwork, a desire to please their customers, an extremely delicious burger patty, as well as the staff on site doing the best they could to accommodate my food allergy.\nI noticed that the kitchen itself was somewhat clean on the surfaces, but also somewhat disorganized and I also saw some things on the storage shelf from behind the counter which concerned me. French fries all over the kitchen floor and garbage under the counter storage unit in the middle of the kitchen. This is completely unacceptable for any establishment!\nIt would also appear that they do not know the Allergan listing for all of their components. For example they could not tell me what was in the buns that they use etc. They suggested a bowl or a lettuce wrap which I was happy to oblige. The lettuce they used to wrap my burger was fresh. However they didn't wilt it at all. As a result it was a lot of lettuce in a big mess around my burger and I had to peel the lettuce away to get to the burger so that I could eat it. Other burger chains or places which execute lettuce wraps are able to do so in a way that makes it like a bun so I think this staff need some additional training in that area. Now onto the fries! They are clearly the frozen variety of french fry which they then deep fry. Their fryer oil tasted old --- while they came out hot and crispy, these fries had an unpalatable taste to them. Typically this is a sign that the fryer oil is old and has not been changed in quite some time and that the fryer unit itself has also not been properly and thoroughly cleaned in sometime as well. I could not eat these french fries! So my meal consisted of an iced tea and a burger patty and a little bit of lettuce. Perhaps others will have better luck in this establishment I think they could be great if they solve the problems I have listed here.\nAlso I want to say that the manager or the lead person on staff did go out of his way to make my burger and fries as allergen free as he could. I don't blame him or the staff for the issues that I encountered -- these are management or owner issues which should be resolved right away."

We ordered a standard cheeseburger, Brandon Burger, Large Fries, Oreo Milkshake, and Drink. The staff were very friendly and helpful in placing the order. All items ordered were great but I di really have to give major props regarding the signature Brandon Burger and their fries. The contents of the Brandon Burger is\u00a0Brandon sauce, extra bacon, and extra provolone cheese.i The fries were a really good shape/thickness unlike any other but the biggest part is that unlike all other burger places they give you a copious amount of fries and worth every dollar.

I chose the build your own  double burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, Mayo, ketchup, and mustard. The staff was very friendly and attentive and worked very efficiently. The burger was hot and very juicy! All the toppings were fresh. I also ordered a small fry and the order was huge. The fries that fell out of the container was almost another full order. The fries were seasoned. I don't like seasoned fries but there were piping hot. I tried them in the Brandon sauce that comes with them; it was a a Mayo ketchup based sauce and had a nice kick to it. I also ordered an Oreo cookie shake and it was delicious and very creamy. The only disappointment was that they have a Gold Peak tea machine instead of real sweet tea; this is just my personal preference and I can't stand the stuff. I will say that they probably should have trays or larger wrapping paper for the burgers- they were very juicy and it was hard to keep the juice and toppings from dripping on the table.

And it is same owners as the Five Guys for both locations (the other is on Bloomingdale).\n\nPrice points are better than Five Guys because they have 1) $2.99 combo that adds fries/drink (for some reason not on the menu, but the master chef shared this with me) and 2) the regular fry price is several $s cheaper, but still more fries than one individual can finish \n\nFries: Excellent...made fresh for my visit, so piping hot...and so good I spent the first five minutes just eating fries before getting into the burger.  Did I say HUGE portion!  The price of $2.29 is higher than what shows on the one menu picture in Yelp, but is way worth it for the amount of fries two could easily share and be happy...\n\nBurger:\nI had the single, which is similar in size to Five Guys.  Lot of condiment choices.  Three cheese (American, provolone & pepper jack) to choose from for an extra 50 cents.  Above average for a fast food establishment.\n\nDrink machine is open and offers many Coca Cola choices; along with Gold Peak tea \n\nPlenty of seating; including a umbrella covered picnic table outside.  Big TV inside that was playing Netflix with subtitles....and the current music on the quality speakers was perfect.\n\nThis place opened in August 2020 and you should really try it.  I walked almost a mile round trip for lunch and it didn't disappoint.  The master chef came out once during my meal to ask how it was, then again after to take my trash.

They didn't and we had to speak to multiple people to give them our correct address. Then when we didn't get our delivery after an hour, we called and found out that the driver was sent out with our order with an incorrect address AND incorrect phone number. They sent the driver back out, this time to our correct address. The pizza was still hot, but by then my milkshake was completely melted."

The location itself weirded me out tbh. We were already there and quite honestly, thought la cucharita is right down the road if anything. \nI went with my mom and decided to split a plate.

The empanadas came out luke warm. Such a disappointment! Nothing better than a piping hot and crispy empanada. (And they were all 1 type) \nThen we settled in for a looong wait. 30 mins later i asked if the waiter could check on our food. He apologized because they were short a cook. He then immediately brought our food. (?) The beans were cold on all the Paisa plates we ordered. I had ordered a breakfast meal (it was noon when we arrived) my scrambled eggs (huevos pericos) were stone cold. My \"Calentado Traditional\" (literally has hot in the name) was anything but. The bean, rice, sausage mixture was luke warm on outside and also cold on inside. \nThis visit is reason enough to not return. Shame, the murals are very nice.\nLet me also say. I am Colombian.

Who does that? I have never been at an establishment that poured out the entire bottle in a carafe. She didn't even have the carafe in a bucket of ice until I asked her how was it supposed to stay cold? We were not happy as we didn't know this was the policy all because someone got into a fight there and hit someone over the head with a bottle. If it's policy, post it or let your customers know! We all know that if Champagne is poured too fast, it will lose its complexity and needs the right amount of air to be perfectly aerated... otherwise it's ruined!! the bartenders argued with us about not taking it off our $238 bill. We didn't even drink it. The manager admitted that this wasn't their policy indeed (as that was only for bottles of liquor and they still didn't take it off the bill.

You can pick as many or as little courses as you like. But be careful, each course is generously portioned. Appetizer, entree, and desert will probably be around $50 all together and another $15 if you want two more courses (around $7/ea). My wife and I each got 5 courses and total 4 drinks. Bill was $180 after tip. That's pretty dang good for all the food and drinks we got.... Service was not rushed at all..... this is a place to sit down and spend 4 hours with friends and family if you want. The Chef also spent time talking with us about the menu, his  experience and inspirations. A lot of fun! \n\n\"Portofino\" is going to become really popular. No wonder why it's reservations only! A lot of fun getting that level of service and food for such a good price. \n\nThere were Lamborghinis and Ferraris there, so clearly people who like Italian products approve of this restaurant!

It was clean, the service was friendly and efficient and the food was good. We ordered steak tacos and a steak burrito bowl. The steak wasn't seasoned enough, but it was SO tender and cooked perfectly. The burrito bowl was a real highlight though. Lots of toppings with the peppers, onions, guacamole and sour cream. The base of beans and rice were so tasty and tasted homemade. I also love horchata, and this one tasted homemade as well not from a mix. Great flavor."

The chips are average but they have great cheese dip. Also their beans are delicious. The total can easily add up. It's $30 for 2 of us to eat tacos and chips and cheese. No drinks.

I tried to visit on opening night, but the line was long & my stomach was empty, so I went elsewhere. Tonight, I finally got to try Rivas @11:30pm, after ending a busy restaurant shift. I ordered the steak fries & my boyfriend ordered the carne asada plate w/ corn tortillas. It cost $24 & some change, which seemed somewhat pricey considering we didn't even get drinks. But, we hoped the carne asade was worth it & also a good indicator of the quality of the food. We got our heavy bags, went home & were extremely disappointed once we opened the containers. \nI will lead with the postive: the portions are HUGE...I guess that's the only positive, honestly. I had very few bites of my steak fries. Immediately, the flavor of the meat bothered me. It tasted like it had been cooked on the same dirty griddle from the old philly cheesesteak restaurant that used to be in the same location. It smelled and tasted of old grease, which is really odd because they have completely transformed the building & it should be like new. The guacamole was obviously pre-packaged; it had the bright color and flavor of store bought guac, which was a little disappointing. I was hoping there would be fresh avocados at a Mexican restaurant, but maybe I expect too much. I would have gladly paid as much for 2 pounds less of the steak fries & real guacamole instead. Also, there really wasn't much to the actual fries. Yeah, there was like 10 pounds (ok maybe 3) but it was fries, gross meat, cheese & gross guac. \nOn to my BF's food....as you can see in the pic, it is not the carne asada plate that he ordered, but actually what looks to be steak fajitas. He didn't try his. He doesn't eat bell peppers & I think the disappointment of the incorrect order ruined his appetite. I tried it and couldn't get past the flavor of this same gross meat. Didn't try the rice or beans. Didn't care at that point. \nI feel like my 3 stars rating is generous because I will most likely never go back. I wish they gave people reasonable portions, with fresher ingredients and took the time to make sure everything they handed us was correct & something they would actually want to eat themselves. There was so much wrong with such simple food. I will stick to the taco trucks."

I could smell it all the way home from the take out bag. \u00a0Take one bite of the burrito and couldn't even swallow it. \u00a0 It was so disgusting. \u00a0No flavor to anything except this really bad after taste, kinda goes along with the smell. \u00a0They charge you $4 to add guac, $2 to add rice, \u00a0making a brcg a $11 burrito. \u00a0I wouldn't care if it tasted ok. \u00a0But I literally just tossed the whole thing in the garbage. \u00a0 If it wasn't so bad I might give them another try and chalk it up to being so late at night. \u00a0But the horrible taste literally might make me steer clear of Mexican food period, the thought of it now grosses me out. \u00a0 It was that bad. \u00a0Really I'm thinking maybe they used a gross towel or sponge to wipe down the grill or something. \u00a0That's the only thing I can imagine making food taste that bad. \u00a0I hate leaving bad reviews. \u00a0 Had really high hopes for this place, but if you want better Mexican food I recommend Roberto's down the street off McCarren."

Because it was opening night, I'm not quite sure if it will remain \"seat yourself\" or not. The atmosphere tended slightly more towards a bar than restaurant. \n\nThere were so many daiquiri flavors! Wedding cake, peach Bellini, banana, Blue Hawaiian, margarita, Pina colada, strawberry, jungle juice, 190 antifreeze, and White Russian. One I have never tried before was Red Bull. I asked our wonderful waitress, who was from Chalmette, and she said that Red Bull is their signature daiquiri. The traditional flavors will stay, but seasonal flavors may be traded in with other flavors such as wedding cake. She mentioned their other location in Chalmette, and I remembered that it was quite good as well.\n\nMy mom and I split the chips and queso with ground meat as well as the taco pizza. Besides a few little messups - it was their opening night after all - everything was wonderful. The employees were very friendly and quick to fix our issues. Unfortunately, the menu does need to be edited. I'm not sure exactly what is the correct version, but our pizza had jalape\u00f1os (which aren't in the taco pizza details), and the meat was missing. They offered to rush out another pizza for us, but we opted to keep the pizza we had because we were already pretty full from our tasty queso with meat. We were pleasantly surprised to see that our taco pizza had been backed off our check, and my stepfather will love his leftover pieces of taco pizza with all the additional jalape\u00f1os we took off of our pieces. \n\nWe enjoyed the crust of the taco pizza A LOT! It had a good crunch.\n\nAltogether, I believe their opening night is going well. With a variety of daiquiris, a nice selection of food options, and friendly employees they are set for success. We will definitely be back; we have more food to sample!"

The chicken was breaded and fried just the way I like it (& didn't have any of that chewy sinew which you run into at a lot of places).

The buns are huge, and the burgers thin. Skip it and get the chicken sandwich. The cheese curds were soft, instead of rubbery, which you typically find. The Mac and cheese was good, too!

The front manager who worked the register, Fiesta, kept checking in on us and was super nice and friendly! My friend and I are excited to come back and try more items, especially the SmOreos and Mac n Cheese. We told all of our friends/coworkers about Fullyloves.

I was content with my dinner so I just stole a couple of his fries, but I wasn't envious of his burger and fries one bit--the fries tasted like the oil they were fried in was too old and the burger looked unappetizing... I asked him, \"How's the burger?\" and he showed me the paper thin beef patty and made a grossed out expression as his answer. \n\nI can't speak personally for the burger, only the few fries, which weren't good, but I will say I don't think I've ever seen my SO this unhappy with food in the last 5 years that we've been together. We left and continued walking down fourth and he commented, \"That had to have been the worst burger I've had in ten years. It was like a $5 cafeteria burger, but worse.\" He went on and on about it until we got to University Blvd, and he's more the quiet type so I was actually surprised by his lengthy dialogue. \n\nJust when I thought the tale of the terrible burger was over, several hours later when we were in bed and starting to fall asleep, he said out of nowhere, \"I just. I just can't believe how awful that burger was...\" I chuckled because I couldn't believe he was STILL thinking about it hours and hours later, but it must've really been memorably bad. \n\nI don't believe I could pay him to go back. But I'm always a believer in second chances so perhaps one day I'll go there by myself and update this review. Not any time soon, though."

I didnt have much dishes to chose from. They have only a few main dishes but they made my chicken sandwich well. I thought the price was high, hence my grumpiness, but I didn't realize I get a side. I  was offered fries, onion rings, veggie chips or sauteed veggies. I went with fries. They tasted like they were freshly cut and seasoned just right. Back to my sandwich. It wasn't some cheap fried patty. The best way I can explain is extra crunchy with big pieces of breading. The bun had the right amount of moisture and crumbled in my mouth. Not like any brioche I've ever had. And the pickles, yum. I am a picky eater and i didnt have to modify the sandwich any way.\n\nThe misses had their curds. Pretty tasty as well. They add some herbs that brings it through. Not as heavily battered like Culvers, but not lightly battered either.\n\nThe reasons I deducted a star are small amount of curds, the seating was limited and very sticky. The seats and table tops were painted using house latex. My pants were sticking. My arms were sticking so bad that when i lifted my arms some skin was left in the paint. Kinda gross to think how much of other peoples DNA was embedded in the table. Also, I know its petty, but they charged 75 cents for a side of ranch.\n\nThe onion rings looked delicious and I hate onion rings.\n\nWe also got deep fried oreos. They are good as you can imagine.\n\nI would love to come back, but the 4th street development is causing parking to be a nightmare. \n\nOh yeah, they had Franks Red Hot packets. Good move."

It looked busy, but it didn't look like there was much organization in the kitchen. Grill mostly empty, no one taking charge. Burger tasted good but since they put two burgers, only partially wrapped in foil on the bottom of the bag under two orders of fries and onion rings, the burgers were destroyed during the walk up stairs to my table. I can only imagine the atrocities you'd find if it was carried further or driven somewhere by Door Dash. I thought the idea of cheezwhiz on onion rings sounded endearing, but it was very anticlimactic. It appeared to be straight out of the can and was very heavy tasting and applied heavy handedly. The chili on the fries was lackluster as well and no utensils were in the bag so it was a messy adventure. \n\nIt wasn't all bad. The staff was polite even if inefficient. The big bright spot was the thin, crispy edge burger and the dandy sauce. Both tasted great. \nBetter packaging for take out would be necessary. See photo for how burger was wrapped. This was laying in the bottom of the bag. \n\nI expect far more from a place where 2 burgers and chili fries and a pile of onion rings with cheez whiz is $42. \n\nIt's good, but there are other options at the test kitchen and I'll try them."

All of their burgers are diner-style smash burgers and you can get anywhere from one to three patties. You can then get those roadhouse style (with American cheese), old John style (shrettuce, pickle, onion, tomato, mustard, Mayo, American cheese), dandy (shrettuce, onion, pickle, tomato, American cheese, rempujase) or the NJB style, mentioned above. Soooo delicious! \n\nShout out to local chef Neal Brown for crushing another local foodie endeavor.

                "text": "One of the success stories of the Fishers Test Kitchen at the Yard is that there has already been a transition from one of the businesses to a replacement.  One Trick Pony has stepped into the last kitchen area in the row of pop up test kitchens next to Sun King.  I got a chance to talk after my lunch with the man running the restaurant.  He has grand hopes for franchising his concept across the whole country to maybe 1200 businesses!  Talk about ambition.  The key to that is finding out how your first business is received and ironing out any problems before you go big!  I must say that this is an impressive start.\n\nFirst, the name:  \"One Trick Pony\" refers to their logo which states \"We do one thing really well.  An that's hot, fresh, smashed burgers that are diner style, made to order, & pressed on a hot griddle\".  That is definitely true.  I ordered a double burger and each of the patties (about a quarter pound) was individually seasoned and seared to bring out the deep beef taste.  \n\nKnow that you can order a single, double, or triple burger.  Instead of telling them what you want on your order, they have \"Styles\" of toppings you can select.  I picked the Old John style which has shrettuce (shredded lettuce), pickle, onion, tomato, mustard, mayo, and American Cheese.  There are several other styles you can order and if you need other condiments, there were some packets near the cash register, so be sure to look if your \"style\" doesn't come with a particular one.\n\nI also ordered a side of fries.  You can get just plain fries or onion rings, but you can also order them with many types of sauces/cheeses (basically a poutine).   \n\nLet me say that the first bite of my burger had a great crunch to it!  Crisp toppings (pickle, onion, tomato) and a crisp sear to each of the burgers was a pleasant surprise.  That's the way I like my burger and although there was a lot to eat, I didn't feel like I had any trouble fitting these smashed burgers in my mouth.  (Much different than eating the half pound Big Mouth Burgers that are usually underseasoned and rely upon the toppings for flavor.  If anything, by seasoning each of the burgers, they were almost too salty by the end, but they didn't get too bad because of all the toppings on mine.\n\nThe cheesy style fries were okay.  The cheese reminded my of the creamy smooth Cheez- Whiz style so that it could be pourable/dip-able.  I noticed that the cheese was poured directly onto the fries and by the time I got to the end, the fries were getting soggy.  After lunch, I stopped by and asked if the owner would like any feedback.  I suggested they pour the sauces/cheese for the fries into a small cup and let the customer dip the fries.  He said he really like that idea and thought it would be really helpful for carryout orders.  So if you get fries with a topping and don't want to eat them first, simply ask for the sauce on the side!\n\nThe stand along fries seemed crisp and already salted, so my wife grabbed some ketchup packets from the counter for hers.\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our food and interaction with the owner.  \n\nOne thing you should be aware of if you go in for lunch:  Sun King doesn't open until the middle afternoon, so you will need to order a beverage from the restaurant, or wait until later in the day if you want a beer with your meal.  Don't blame One Trick Pony if you can't get a beer.  This business is not associated with Sun King in any way other than sharing the same dining room.\n\nNote that like the other food places in the Test Kitchen, you pay when you order and they give you a buzzer that lets you know your food is ready to come pick up.  That way you can stake claim to one of the seating places in the common seating area.  Also note that napkins and plasticware are located at stations near the entrance.  Down below is the place you can throw away your trash.  (I believe Sun King busses the tables later in the day.)  Near those stations, they also have sanitizer and cloths you can use to spray your own table and chairs before sitting if you are uncertain when the last time it was sanitized.  \n\nIt's nice to see a new business looking successful during these difficult times.  We enjoyed our experience and would gladly return to dine again!\n\nNote that it isn't a cheap burger place like the fast food places, but depending upon the number of burgers you stack on your sandwich, the price can climb fairly fast.  But the prices are clearly posted.  Just pay attention before you order and you will be okay!\n\nReview #3816"

This evening though we had some friends from out of town who wanted to go to the Sun King Brewery and since the test kitchen is there we also made it dinner. Ordering was easy and the service was good but the food...is unimpressive. \n\nI got the RazorBack and my wife got a Build-Your-Own (basic burger). Both of us commented that you can get a better burger at the local Culvers, and for a lot less. There just wasn't any flavor in our burgers. My bun was a bit stale on the top, not sure why. Also, I'm not certain what Dandy sauce is, but I can tell you that it doesn't really have much of a flavor thus it wasn't dandy.. I expected that a $12 burger would be pretty great but it was pretty disappointing. There just wasn't any flavor...at all.\n\nNext up, the chilli-cheese fries. These too fell flat. I felt like I was eating them to just get the money back that I'd spent on them. I didn't enjoy them. The fries are just you basic crinkly fries. The cheese and chilli...meh. I'm not sure what all of the intent is here but It all falls flat and fairly tasteless.\n\nGiven that there are sooooo many great burger places around, some for a fraction of a cost, to have an expensive burger that is fairly tasteless and chilli-cheese fries that are attempting to be something they are not, you are better off trying something else.\n\nI rarely write a bad review as I can usually find something to find some pleasure in, but this was one of those places.

I saw on their Instagram page they were running a special on Thursday's, a single burger and fry for $6.00 so I finally made it there last night and it definitely did not disappoint. \n \nI ordered my single patty with cheese, shredduce, tomato, pickles, mustard, and ketchup. All the vegetables were crisp and fresh, loved the pickles they are thick and they put several on my burger. Also love that the lettuce is shredded (hence the word shredduce). If I had to do it over again I think I would order a double though because the patties are thin, go with the less is more on a single. But don't let the thin patty fool you it's full of flavor! \n\nThe fries were absolutely amazing as well! Hot and crunchy! Everything is made to order so it's all hot and fresh. \n\nDefinitely recommend OTP if you've got that \" I just need a good cheeseburger and fry craving\""

Cheese fries where just fries, NO cheese, no salt.\n\nVERY DISAPPOINTED $70.00 of bad food!"

First time I visited I ordered a single patty with shreduce, pickles, cheese and dandy sauce and it was delicious! I'm a sucker for some crinkle cut fries and these were fried to my liking with an extra crunch! All burgers are customizable to your liking and you can have up to 3 smash burger patties per sandwich. \n\nFor St. Patty's week they brought in a Reuben twist. I ordered it with a single burger and all the toppings and I think I ate it all in like 2 bites? If you haven't tried OTP yet, this is your time to go and try this new \"burger\" before it leaves after this weekend. They also just opened up a second location in the sun king in Broad Ripple so if you're looking for something a little more south check out the new location.

I got a burger with everything and some fries.\nI was impressed with my burger, it's the smash style which is one of my favorites, nice crispy outer rim, and the middle was juicy and flavorful.\nThe fries are worth checking as well, crispy and just the right amount of salt.

Our server was very polite and attended us in a timely order. 2 of us ordered the tide wings and the other chicken tacos. I also ordered a side of nachos fir the table too. Honestly everything was very good, everyone well spread due to covid and everyone wearing masks and moderate noise level. The food was very good also. And honestly I may have to say their wings maybe better than the ones at their Prater location. All I gotta say is good job at this location. Might go there more often since all the other locations are so packed nowadays. And the wait list way too long. But I do understand because of covid.

                "text": "UPDATE 12-1-21\nEver since my first visit I've been hankering for fish and chips again. As predicted...my husband and I SHARED ONE ORDER. (SEE PICTURE OF TWO PLATES...that's one order) Megan was a spectacular waitress. She had them split one order onto two plates. Soooo very thoughtful and appreciated. THANK YOU!  After eating I was really already full but since we split an order we went ahead and shared a piece of caramel cheesecake. And now I'm definitely happily overstuffed again. \n\nNOTE TO SMOKERS...this location is a non-smoking Pub. If you want to smoke go to the location on Longley. I wanted to try that location today but it was too smoky for non smokers with lung issues, so we left and came here. Each table there has an ash tray...so smokers should love it!\n\nOriginal Review...\nToday is my first visit here after researching Fish & Chips on Yelp. It's been decades since my last trip to London but for some reason I've been dreaming of Fish & Chips. Haven't had them for probably 20 years because they were never good \"enough\" to measure up to London. THE secret to perfect fish and chips is the thinnest crispy batter. I AM SO DELIGHTED TODAY. I believe these are even BETTER than my memory of how much I loved them in London...TOP THAT OFF with understanding I have never even heard of BEER BATTER FRIES, and I'm sitting here OVER THE MOON. I usually don't even like fries. Oh my gosh golly gum shucks. I have never had French fries THIS DELICIOUS. Honestly though, the TARTER SAUCE is the real reason I usually eat fish.  And once again, I'm so picky it's hard to find PERFECT tarter sauce. But HERE IT IS. Even the coleslaw was PERFECT SLAW. And the kicker is HUGE PORTIONS. So if I could give this place 10 STARS I definitely would with regards to fish and chips. I'm actually taking half my meal home. Very unusual for me. I usually just stuff myself because I was taught not to leave food on my plate. But half DID stuff me. I will SOOOO BE BACK. But next time we will split one meal. Which makes eating here a serious BARGAIN. \n\nMy husband doesn't eat hamburgers. Breakfast ended at 11 so the excellent waitress (NANCY) has earned her tip. She made several SMILING trips to get answers for me...and found out ALL the burgers could be ordered with a veggie burger patty. He got the mushroom burger and said it was excellent. But that probably won't matter for us because he will forever be forced to split Fish & Chips with me. (:-)\n\nI'm just guessing that if OUR meal was THIS GREAT...most everything here is probably very good. \n\nITS A SPECIAL DAY when I go in search of a special taste sensation from my youth and discover a place that not only meets my hopeful expectation but EXCEEDS IT. \n\nIf you find this review useful please vote!"

Very tasty but definitely share as it's not something you can eat a lot of.  The only disappointment was the kids menu mac and cheese.

You can make tacos or fajitas they even have a few items for dessert. Along with cheese quesadillas and chicken quesadillas.

I enjoyed their texture, taste and the fact that they were vegan.\n\nFast forward to now, Gaia has a storefront and my daughter is having a birthday party with one of her friends who has a lot of allergies in attendance. I started looking around for vegan cupcakes and learned that Gaia isn't just vegan. They also are gluten free, nut free, soy free, yeast free and artificial color free. This took care of all of the allergies my daughter's friend has.\n\nGaia typically offers a half dozen cupcake flavors and a variety of donuts at their storefront. When I arrived, about an hour and a half after opening, three cupcake flavors were completely sold out! I bought one of their sour citrus, one chocolate and two pineapple. I also bought a pink lemonade and banana split donut. They were running a special at the time, any six items in their case for 25 dollars. \n\nThe people at the party who tried Gaia's desserts were very impressed. The girl I specifically bought desserts for selected a cupcake and donut. She choked up right before she bit into the pink lemonade donut and said this was her first ever donut. Due to her allergies she had never been able to try one before.\n\nThanks Gaia for making this girl's day!"

I know, it was after Christmas, but I'm told some companies like to have their party after and Microsoft Reno is one of 'em.\n\nThey had their event at the Rancharrah Estate, where they have that very famous Mansion, which is one very big house, 58,000 square feet big.\n\nMicrosoft peopled the party with two hundred and fifty of their employees and they had limos coming and going all night long. The people were dressed to the nines and out for an evening of fun and fine dining.\n\nWhich is where Roundabout Catering comes in. Microsoft didn't want a sit down dinner, just hors d'oeuvres for their people to munch on as they schmoozed and oohed and ahed the house the Harrah's built, while the band, which consisted of two kids who could really play, alternated between Eagles and Pink Floyd songs.\n\nRoundabout set up food stations throughout the mansion, a mac and cheese station here, a beef, pork, salmon and potatoes station there, a salad station here, a risotto station there, an antipasto station here the desert station on the grand piano. And, of course, they had a full bar, but you didn't have to fight the crowd to belly up to it if you wanted a drink, because Roundabout had their people walking the floor with wine and beer on trays.\n\nWe had dinner before we left for the event, because we're professionals and professionals work at events like this, they don't chow down.\n\nHowever, as soon as I saw Natalie, who works for Roundabout, I knew who was catering the event and I knew I'd be sneaking food all night long. And I did. Roundabout are one of the best caterers in America and not only does the faire they prepare threaten to send you to gourmet heaven, the presentation is as good as any you'd find in the world's finest restaurants.\n\nBut fine food and prestigious presentation will only get you so far in the catering business. To really succeed, to make the event a caterer is catering a real success, he or she has to have people pleasing people working for them and it goes without saying they have to be people pleasing people themselves.\n\nNo matter how delicious something is, if it's served by a grumpy grump with a food stained shirt, you're not gonna take away a nice picture of the server or the food she served. The Roundabout people all were clean, pressed uniforms.\n\nAnd Chef Colin Smith and his wife MaryBeth have outdone themselves with their choice of staff. Every lickin' stickin' person in their employ serves with a smile and by the time the events they cater are over, the guests leave with a tinge of regret, because deep down inside they don't wanna go.\n\n-----\n\nA note about the photos I've posted: I didn't plan on reviewing Roundabout Catering when Vesta and I showed up at Rancharrah, but as the evening wore on and as I interacted with their staff, I began to think I might. So I went around the mansion and made photos of the food, thinking I'd post them with the review.\n\nBut I found several similar shots, both here and on their Facebook page of the food they serve and it's presentation, by better photographers then me. So I decided to post photos of the Roundabout People, because, I believe, they are the rock their business is founded on, even though their faire is divine."

A very thorough spread sheet with weeks worth of ideas for our crew. They put together everything you would need for a complete lunch menu. We received a wide variety of choices from  the main dish, wonderful side dishes right down to the desert, and of course, what the vegan, vegetarians and gluten free people could choose from also. I didn't have to even think about it, just choose from the easy menu plan they provided me.\n\nThank you Roundabout Catering I give you 10 stars!!!"

They also gave us a tour of the facility right away, which was much appreciated. Very willing to help us stick with our budget (which we went over anyway, our own choosing), and showed us how the prices would add up based on what menu we chose (as I assume most places will, I was just excited to see it done so I didn't have to do it myself), and very helpful when suggesting other things we may need for the wedding as well. They were not pushy about us using them, but very respectable when checking in about a decision. The options available are numerous and all looked very delicious. \nWe decided to choose them and got to meet with Chef Colin. He, like all his other staff was very kind and helpful. We chose a BBQ style buffet in which we had brisket, chicken, cornbread, etc. I can't even remember it all. We chose this for the adult guests at our wedding, and a macaroni bar for the kids. Chef Colin helped us customize the macaroni bar to what kids would be more open to eating as toppings. \nWedding day arrives. They were on time! (I was worried about anything going late that day of course), So I very much appreciate that. The food was very good, had excellent flavor, and there was plenty! The staff were very kind to us and our guests. There were really only two downsides, the food was a tad cold for my liking, but wasn't enough to upset me on a global scale haha, and the second thing was the cornbread. Mind you, I absolutely LOVE cornbread. My cousin (when she lived with me) used to think I was high because I'd be up at 3am making cornbread, solely on the fact that I loved it so much. Anyways, the cornbread from Roundabout. It had peppers in it. I've never in my life heard of cornbread with peppers in it. And unfortunately, I am allergic to them. Nothing happened, thankfully, as it's not severe allergy, but enough to where I choose to stay away from them so I don't risk anything. I was unaware of the peppers until I bit into the cornbread. I didn't even like the flavor of it, the peppers just made it taste off anyway. It was upsetting not knowing about the fact that peppers were in it. Even if I wasn't allergic, I wouldn't have asked for it because of the taste. I do not even remember being asked about allergies in the menu-decision process, so that could be changed. Other than that, the catering was excellent. Truly. I am glad we chose them to cater our wedding."

Beth & Chef Colin hosted us for a fun tasting where we fine tuned the menu.  \n\nUpon our wedding day, the Roundabout team provided six passed apps, a salad station, a hot food station (Argentine Asado), and fun ice cream sandwiches as we opted not to have a traditional wedding cake.  We did not want a seated dinner, and they provided a classy meal with beautiful place settings / gold cutlery!  The servers of the passed apps didn't have much travelling to do as our guests would chase them down for the tasty treats!

Holy beejeebus Roundabout NAILED it.  \nThey brought in a classic (and super tasty) caesar salad, freaking amazing calzones, AND tiramisu for dessert.\nFirst of all the calzones were huge, second of all they gave us options-meat, veggie, and gluten free.  Gluten free was basically a dough-less calzone but hey-super cool for the few people in my office who are GF to get real food!  I opted for the veggie and I was so, so happy.  You know how you can look at food and just KNOW it's going to be good? That's how this calzone was.  It was cooked to perfection-the perfect golden crust and melty cheese.  The veggies tasted fresh too.  I couldn't even finish it.  Half is in the fridge for me to enjoy later.  They also brought a tray of GORGEOUS grilled veggies.  Despite being full I tried one-just to try it and let me tell you what.  That grilled asparagus tasted just like summer.  Like summer I say!  Everything felt healthy too.

                "text": "THIS review is for ONLY for the prepared meal delivery plan from GymRatFoods.com, and it is long overdue. \n\nWe enjoyed 4 weeks of food in April 2019. I've held on to my receipt in a pile of papers because this plan really deserves a review. \n\nFirst off, YES the food is REALLY GOOD. However this is the only pre-prepared delivered meal plan I've ever tried so I have no comparison. Although I DO know the difference between good food and bad food. AND THIS WAS DEFINITELY GOOD. \n\nMy only issue was that the portions seemed to weigh much more than what was printed on the wrapper. Normally a good thing. Right?  Getting more than you paid for?  But if you're try to loose weight it's not good to eat more than you think you're eating. So if I did this again, to loose weight, I'd definitely ask about how I'm supposed to know if I've been given correct portions. \n\nI was doing it mostly to get off sugar. To just stop eating too much sugar. Retrain myself to eat more healthy. And to give myself meal planning ideas to get out of my food rut. \n\nSo one thing that was awesome was that they allowed me to share my 4 week plan with my husband. Meaning, we each got 2 weeks of food. They allowed us to order different meal plans. So we each got 2 weeks of our chosen plan. They allowed us to substitute all the red meat and pork for chicken. \n\nThat's a lot of allowing. The only thing they DIDN'T allow (almost a year ago) was a VEGETARIAN option. There was kinda a lotta meat if you don't usually eat much meat. So I'd probably have a hard time getting my husband to do it again since he's basically a vegetarian. He had a hard time. But he is also a very good sport and so he sacrificed 2 weeks for me. \n\nI did the full 1200 calories a day (3 meals a day + snacks) X 6 days a week. If I did it again I'd do the 1200 calories per day (equivalent) but only 2 meals a day no snacks x 5 days a week. I just looked it up and it's only $375 for ALL 4 WEEKS. That plan doesn't provide the whole 1200 calories a day...because it skips breakfast and snacks. I'd rather pay less and get less and just fill in a few items I'm craving as needed. \n\nA few times I froze the meals because we had to eat out. They were still great even though they had been frozen. \n\nI paid extra for home delivery. The fresh cooked meals are delivered in plastic bins with frozen cold packs to keep them cool. They are delivered twice a week. Even getting meals for two people we always had plenty of space in our refrigerator for them. \n\nI recommend you go into the office in Sparks and sit down and look at the menus and ask questions. They will show you what actual meals look like. They give you a couple free samples to take home. That pretty much sold me. I tasted it and thought \"I CAN DEFINITELY DO THIS\". You should check it out before you sign up for some other plan!  \n\nIf you find this review useful please vote!"

Besides doing catering for any number of occasions, they decided to get into meal prep. Thee on-site dietitian works with you for the menu that best suits your needs you determine the calories that you want in your your meals per day and they resign the meals around that you choose from I have very extensive menu your case and they match the calories to your desire gosh what a great great car procedure in the individual customer a meal prep I absolutely could be your happy hour with Round Bout Catering and plan to stay with him for sometime in the future again I give them five stars and highly recommend ceiling the entire staff at roundabout.

The signature beer that was supposed to be served  wasn't even ordered. The service staff was slow and unresponsive. One server was either really tired or under the influence. Many guests commented on her behavior. The bartender didn't appear at the reception for the first hour. I had to leave my meal repeatedly to ask the Roundabout coordinator about different issues.\n\nWhen I called Roundabout after the wedding I got no return call. I gave up and wrote a letter to Colin. He called me back and left a message he was sorry and would make it right. That was three years ago and I haven't heard from Roundabout since. Although nothing can \"make it right\" since this was a once in a lifetime event, some effort to follow up would seem appropriate.\n\nThis was a once in a lifetime event that was carefully planned and every detail attended to. The poor food and poor service ruined our beautiful day. \n\nI have waited three years to write this review in an attempt to be fair. However, after seeing a huge article about Roundabout in today's paper, I am moved to    share our experience. The Smith's are nice folks whose business has grown dramatically in the last few years. I am happy for their success but their poor food and service ruined a special day.\n\nUpdate: \nAfter posting this review, I got a reply (above) from one  of the Roundabout staff saying they would contact me privately. It has been a month and still no contact. \n\nI was hoping they would somehow want to rectify the terrible experience of a once in a lifetime event, but guess not."

According to their menu, their NY brick-oven pies consist of a \"combination of their 72 hour aged dough, their red sauce made daily using the finest vine ripened tomatoes and locally made sliced mozzarella make for an amazingly great pizza.\" \n\nI began my evening with a glass of Blackberry Boom from Meriwether Cider (6.9% ABV, $7.50 for a 16 oz), and my husband tried the Rocket Dog from Laughing Dog Brewery (6.7% ABV, $5.50 for 16 oz). While I can't critique on the quality/experience with the beer and cider since it's an entirely different company however I found the price for the cider a little steep. Not sure if that's just the brewery so no stars lost just an opinion stated. \n\nFor food we shared the Pepperoni Lovers (vine-ripened red sauce, fresh mozzarella, spicy cup and char pepperoni and traditiona pepperoni, 12.00 for a 12 inch). I was a huge fan of the cupped pepperoni - it's definitely the way I prefer my pepperoni slices! However, I was not a fan of the thin crust. I like my bread thic! I can only hope in the future they offer more traditional or deep-dish pies. \n\nAll in all, I'll go back, but I can say it will be soon. Knowing me though, and my constant uncontrollable cravings for pizza, it'll be sooner than later."

I can't get past their ultimate pepperoni. It's my favorite. My husband loves their bbq chicken (or something like that). They have options to build your own as well. Keep it simple though. I am a fan of thin crust pizza and 3 Wood Pizza & Pub does not disappoint. It even tastes incredible the next day and cold (yes, I love some good cold pizza).

He let us sample, recommended his favorites, informed us all about the pizza selections, and made excellent conversation. The owner eventually made his way over and continued to engage in conversation with us as well, and we all talked food industry as I'm a bartender myself. I later saw the owner folding pizza boxes along side other employees and that impressed the hell out of me, as I know plenty of owners and managers that wouldn't touch tedious side work like that. After we finished our delicious pizzas and beers, we were lucky enough to be given a tour of the kitchen and continued to chat with the bartender.

The cheese sticks to one side when you open the loaf.\n\nThe prices were VERY reasonable and the staff were very friendly, even just for a simple takeout order.\n\nWe will be back...frequently.

I ordered the freight train and pepperoni lover (they allowed me to do half and half). The pizza is 12 inches and perfect for sharing (2 folks). The freight train has their house made Vine-ripened red sauce, Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, smoked ham, onions, green peppers, mushrooms, mozzarella, and finished with a Pecorino Romano cheese. The pepperoni features spicy cup and char pepperoni which is unique to them (very flavorful). I loved their red sauce, crust, and the cheese on their pizza-it was yummy!! Their pizzas are reasonably priced coming out at $12. The only negative was our waiter she clearly needs more training. She took our order and then came back asking what we wanted again. I ordered a side salad she forgot about it; then tried to charge us for it (I said I never got it; she was like do you want it to go? Haha). Plus she gave me the wrong ticket to start with; she was clearly off point and needs a lot more training. I'd say outside the customer service this newcomer to the boise pizza scene is a must try!!"

My favorite was the Apple Tarte Tatin (pressed caramelized apples, caramel mousse, rosemary sucree). The rosemary sucree was so delicious and gave an incredible depth to the tarte tatin. I also loved the Pistachio Tea Cake (shortbread crust, pistachio frangipane, pistachio ganache) - it was so smooth and creamy. Finally, we had the Hazelnut Paris Brest (toasted hazelnut pate choux with praline mousseline, hazelnut crispy).

It was $20, I've included the debit charge so you can see what I paid for the three items (one slice of cake, one cookie, one bar total $29.50). So nothing but truth here and that's what my review is about- my rating of my overall experience at your establishment, as it should be. \nAlso want to point out I did not tell people not to go here anymore, just don't buy the cake slices because they are outrageously expensive and mediocre. I also review the taste of the items, as It's all relevant. \n\nAlso Please understand I did say something at the moment, how do you think I learned it was $20! I didn't see a QR code, might have overlooked it But I did have the paper menu and there was the chalkboard menu (or whatever it was) and we also looked online later and none of those things mentioned the cost of the cake at that time that I could see. \n\nYour own response to the original review just confirms:\n1. the cake slice is not prominently displayed \n2. That the cost is actually $15 (still ridiculous for slice of cake) which means I was also incorrectly charged for the item. \n3. That I was giving my patronage to your small business while we are in a pandemic \n4. I didn't demand a refund from your business (because we are in a pandemic and you are a small business). \n\nSo if you are upset about my truthful review that warned people about a slice of cake (because again we are in a pandemic and people might not have $20 to spend on cake slice).\nAcknowledge I might have been overcharged and not offer to look into it to correct it.\nNot take into consideration to maybe just put the price somewhere people can easily see it irl.\nBut instead choose to just complain that I gave you this review in pandemic, WEEKS after I wrote it, then maybe you are really only confirming that you did deserve the rating you got from me for my experience with your business."

I say this as someone who has been to Small Oven PS a handful of times and witnessed this first hand. The majority of my visits have been exemplary and the one time it wasn't, I got his attention and he made it right. I can't say the same about many other establishments I've had similar situations with in the past. What's more, the positive experience has stuck with me. Regarding the food - Great bars, bread pudding, small treats, and other baked goods. You really can't go wrong here with anything you order. My only tip would be for those who order items that required or necessitated cold storage - allow it to warm to room temperature before eating.

I drove, so my husband went inside to grab a menu! He came back with a smile on his face! YAYYYY. He said the food looked good and the prices were actually a bit lower than other Jamaican restauarants.\n\nWe usually order oxtails and pepper steak platters and didn't deviate from that.  Total was $42 for 2 large platters. Seems steep but oxtails are very expensive and honestly would cost us more to make them at home. The platters included THREE sides! Impressive, simply because at  other places you're given a heaping plate of rice and peas and the only other side available is cabbage. Bleh...\n\nJust one star off for not having sweet plantains but I've noticed that this seems to be common when you order Jamaican food later in the day.  No huge biggie.\n\nWhen we returned from shopping to order the food, they were out of the pepper steak so we had 2 large oxtail platters. Mine had rice and peas, collard greens and candied yams.  My husband's had rice and peas, mac n cheese and cabbage.  The YAMS literally tasted like a sweet potato pie and no one can tell me different. AMAZING. The oxtails were smaller BUT they gave us plenty of them.  Nice and tender. I really liked that the rice and peas weren't covered in gravy because I could actually taste the rice and it was seasoned well!

The kids were begging for pizza, and not generally much of a pizza fan, particularly in New Orleans, I decided to order a meatball sub for me and a pizza margherita for the kids. The sub was amazing. Meatballs were nearly all meat with very little filler but moist. Tangy sauce and the bread.... Now onto the pizza, as I said not much of a pizza fan since Ive been in the south, but OMG did this pizza bring me back to the family owned neighborhood pizzerias on Long Island. The kids \"gavoned\" the pie, leaving me a sliver. That mere sliver transported me back in time. Thin, crispy, yet chewy crust with just the right amount of char. The tangy but sweet sauce with the mozz and basil, an absolute hit. Had I known by then, I would have ordered two pies!!! We will definitely be back!"

Thankfully, I was sharing with a few people. \n\nThe pizza here is authentic New York style pizza with that perfect thin crust and cheese and sauce that speaks for itself. The place is family owned and the service is super friendly. It's a small spot, so give the crew some heads up if you plan on being in a big group. Otherwise, take out is a great option.

Given Hurricane Ida and the pandemic, it's been difficult to find open restaurants, in general, much less pizza places. I gave Crazy Italian a try based on the reviews and they did not disappoint. The taste of the back crust reminded me of Papa John's, but not as sweet. \n\nAt 18\", these pizzas are huge! I ordered pepperoni for the kids and a Hawaiian for me and my wife. I also ordered a side of fried mozzarella sticks. I added pepperoni, sausage and red peppers to the Hawaiian, but they forgot the pepperoni. The pizzas were lukewarm by the time they reached us, but they had a nice flavor. I popped a few slices in the air fryer the next day and they were cheesy and tasty. I will say the bottom crust is very soft. I wish the bottom crust was crispier or firmer to hold up to the toppings. The mozzarella sticks were crispy, cheesy and seasoned. I didn't care for the tomato dipping sauce, though, but they went well with a sauce I got from Bavette Grill in Plano, TX. \n\nI expect we'll be ordering again in the future. Maybe we'll eat there in person."

We got the everything bagel, Octoeel and the salmon nigiri.  The everything bagel and Octoeel were okay. I didn't like how they put a lot of fillers on top like cucumbers...basically hiding the roll. The salmon nigiri looked like the regular salmon we get from the grocery store (as opposed to sushi grade salmon)\n\nPrices were pretty high for everything we ordered.

Ordered the Prosciutto and Salsiccia Di Beyond.  \n\nThe Prosciutto was a round flat bread cooked in an oven, than prosciutto and arugula was just dumped on it.  There was almost no mozzarella or fontina on it either.  Nothing was cooked onto the bread at all.  It might as well have been a flat bread open faced sandwich.  Very bland and something I could have made at home, much better as well, without paying $17.00.\n\nThe Salsiccia Di Beyond was another round flat bread that had tomatoes, Beyond Sausage, and broccoli rabe very sporadically placed on it.  The bread was burnt and very bitter.  There were very few ingredients placed onto it as well.  I really would not have paid $18.00 for this, or any price for that matter.  \n\nBoth pizzas were completely bland.  I don't know where these other reviewers have been getting their pizzas, but Pizza Crimine is neither pizza nor is it worth the money."

One would not think that gravy and Frank's red hot would mesh well together but it seemed to work with neither flavor overwhelming the other. The full portion of poutine and ingredients seemed like good value for the money although it could have used a few more chicken pieces. Including a drink it managed to get me full for under $10.00. The staff were also pretty nice. The lady at the till asked my name right away and continued to use it for the duration of the transaction. It was a nice little personal touch that im not used to getting from a fast food restaurant. If I was in the mall again I would have no issues returning.

I stood in line waiting while one of the employees talked to someone she knew who was passing by and the other employee was putting bread away. There was no acknowledgment that I was standing right in front of them or \"I'll be with you in a minute\".  Finally, the employee who was talking asked what I would like.  I have never seen someone move so slow in my life.  You are making a sandwich, not performing surgery.  The second employee just stood in the corner and coached the girl on how much meat she should use.  After what seemed to be forever to make the sandwich it was time to cash out.  Well not so fast.... there were 2 people who just walked up and the lady told me \"just a minute\" and started to take the other orders.  WTH? THE SECOND EMPLOYEE IS STILL STANDING IN THE CORNER.  At this point I was done.  I asked them if they could please check me out now as I was on my lunch break and needed to get back to the office.

My daughter loves the freshly homemade pink tortillas. Those and the pink crema were such a fun touch to the meal. \n\nThe meat is tasty, juicy, and bursting with flavors. \nWe tried the chicken tacos, the quesabirria tacos, and the Mexican Asada pizza. Every one of the dishes had its own savory flavor. The tortillas are homemade daily!\n\nI can't place the chicken flavor, but boy, was it delicious! I wanted to go back for more. This could be bad for me as I live on the opposite corner of where they have popped up! \n\nThe quesabirria tacos are made with chopped-up birria stew meat served with onions, cilantro, and a consomm\u00e9, all in a cheesy pink shell. They are were rich and flavorful. The image of these tacos with the tender, juicy meat and fried, crispy cheese sticking out the top, being dunked into a deep red consomm\u00e9, warms my tummy up! They also serve this delicious meat as Birria Ramen. They do the beef birria stew meat topped with onion, cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh lime juice all over noodles! I can't wait to try this! \n\nMy daughter enjoyed the Mexican Asada pizza and chicken tacos. She is tickled pink to see the pink taco shells and the pink crema! My daughter also requested more of the Mexican wedding cookies they gave us as a treat. These buttery cookies feature ingredients like butter, sugar, spices, and nuts. They are oh so delicious! We have requested an order for three dozen already. We hope our friends enjoy them as much as we did. \n\nThe customer service was fantastic. We spoke about the history of the business and the owners behind the delicious creations. Thank you for the conversation and delicious food! Give them a try, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I hope the Reno Pink Taco Truck will continue to stay in the Sparks area as we lack restaurants in the area....plus, they are so yummy.i\n\n*Edited to add we went back and tried the chicken burrito, Asada tacos and the Birria Ramen. We enjoyed everything and my daughter is already asking for more of the Birria Ramen soup! The chicken burrito was huge!!! It was filled with chicken, beans, rice, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole!

Some employees are friendly and some aren't so much, and my most recent driver's license photo is so bad that I wouldn't be able to pick myself out of a lineup, but if the state of NJ is okay with it, who am I to question?\n\nThis review isn't so much about the Salem office as it is about the state's system; it just took place in the Salem office.  Hubby and I had received notices late last year that we needed to renew our driver's licenses.  The NJ native (me) had to trot in there with my six little points of identification, but the non-native (him) got to \"skip the trip\".  We sent in his payment and forgot about it.  In all of our decades of license renewals (in other states), we've never had a problem.\n\nWe didn't realize until last month that his license had never arrived, so we went to the Salem MVC office to find out what was up.  Sure enough, they looked it up and found where we'd made the payment in plenty of time, but the license just got lost, somewhere.  Now, one might think, based on that info, that they could just reprint the license and send him on his way.  Not in NJ.  We had to pay the entire fee AGAIN, and the reason was (this is priceless) that the first payment was sent to Trenton, but we'd never paid in the Salem office. You just can't make this stuff up.   \n\nSo, we paid the fee AGAIN, got his license, and they gave us a form to fill out and mail in to get a reimbursement of the first payment.  Obviously, the state's computers talk to each other, because the local office was able to see that the payment was made, but it's informational only, nothing that helps us.  We're thinking that maybe we should skip the \"convenience\" of  \"skip the trip\", if we're still here when we need to renew, again.  \n\nEvery day in NJ is a new experience in \"you've GOT to be kidding me!\""

                "text": "Maybe this location could be okay for simple needs like renewing a driver's license -- but things get messy beyond that.\n\nMany years ago, I purchased my car at a local dealership with my mom as the co-owner since I was fresh out of college without much credit history. I recall requesting primary ownership (and subsequently paid it off myself in years to come). But my mom held onto the important docs, and she/Honda lost the title (possibly a postal error, not entirely clear what happened).\n\nSince moving out of state a couple years ago, it's been on my to-do list to attain a new title in order to transfer the registration. I requested one through the mail in July, and about a week ago received a rejection from the state, notating they needed my mom's info. Turns out my car has never had my name on it, which required her to pay for a duplicate title ($60) and \"gift\" the car to me. I was told I needed proof of insurance in VA before that could be done. Our first visit last Thursday to this DMV was long and confusing, but it helped to sort the issue in person rather than states away. Or so it seemed.\n\nI don't know if the workers had a collective case of the Mondays this morning, but without going into every detail:\n\nThe receptionist declined to accept proof of insurance via my phone, even though I was told (erroneously, I'd later learn) that via phone was fine. She tried to send me to the library to print it, which I declined and requested a supervisor. I was given a ticket and had to wait for her. Meanwhile I listened to other associates blatantly talk about me and my issue within earshot.\n\nThe manager basically told me I was a liar, which I did not appreciate. She stood behind her group 100%, wouldn't discuss the issue with my mom via the phone, and refused to provide an email for printing purposes. It's 2019. The DMV really should have a client inbox. Eventually, she caved and provided a fax number. I called my insurance and they sent it right over.\n\nOnce everything was sorted and the first person acknowledged she remembered telling me the incorrect info and apologized (something the manager should have done), I was given a temp tag. I asked how it goes on the car and was told \"there's a screwdriver at reception.\"\n\nI walked to reception and told them/the security officer that I have a bad back and asked if assistance was available. The (male) officer told me that I was fine and it was a simple task, in the most haughty tone. It took everything in me to not go off on him right then. How dare he tell me how I feel? Hell to the no. Not okay.\n\nIt was drizzling out as I worked on the task. A bystander couple then walked up to me halfway through, and the wife told me to let her husband help me. She had heard what I said about my back. How sweet is that? They were so wonderful, and I hope to pay their act of kindness forward.\n\nAs I walked back in with the old plates to surrender them, the security guard announced, \"Good job!\" I told him he needed to learn kindness and he shrugged and started whistling to himself. So rude. Would they treat my 90-year-old Grandmom that way? Or someone with a more obvious health condition? Shame on them for being ageist and apathetic. The DMV should have someone on hand to assist.\n\nFortunately I'm done with the NJ DMV now, but I hope they can maybe kick the disgruntled government workers stereotype and learn that we're all humans, and being rude or cruel isn't professional or necessary."

Let's start with the lousy instruction on where to stand and where to go, next having to fill out the same form 4 times for no other reason than they can't read and organize themselves with just one.  Next the poor attitude of every employee in the building, they were playing on their cell phones and it took three of them to take care of my license.  No appointments for at least four month, poor web services and lack of clear requirements.  Let's just take a moment to remind everyone 23 different states I have done this.  Blame Covid but offer no social distancing for the customer.  New Jersey you need to get your act together.  Last and very much not least I'm baffled at the way I was treated due to being gay, I was called a dyke twice by the middle aged Karen at the desk.  I couldn't get my registration done, bc they need a title (THE ONLY STATE). Then they tried to deny my ability to register to vote.   Lucky for me I have it all on video though I was told I couldn't take a photo or have my camera by the ass hats that \"worked\" there.    New Jersey I am so lucky this is only a one year pit stop!"

Listen y'all if they had cooked this bacon any further it would have been cremated.    I don't mind a bit of crunch to my bacon but come on.   So half way through my sandwich something tastes off not sure if its the meat that had been sitting after being cooked or the almost cremated bacon but it was awful.  I ended up making myself a Peanut butter and Banana sandwich that was 5 stars compared to what that sonic called a bacon cheeseburger."

I used to stay strict to the burritos, but this summer they tried something new that blew me away . They took their cooking outside ! & the idea couldn't have been a better one . They began grilling the steak outside in front the restaurant , & yes , it's amazing ! Literally the BEST taco I ever ate in my life . This brought them so much clientele, put them on the map honestly . I'm so proud of them ! \n\nNow for the cons , cause like , why would I  give them 3 stars if they are the best ? \n\nTwo words : COMMUNICATION & CUSTOMER SERVICE !!!! \n\nI cannot stand trying to order food and not being understood . I understand that everyone isn't perfect but in a restaurant/business setting , I just feel like there is a certain level of professionalism that should be held when dealing with a language barrier . \n\nAs I've stated in other reviews , I am Puerto Rican but choose not to speak it . That's always a big problem I face in Philly . The daytime crew gets it poppin' ! They do their job effortlessly and quickly . The nighttime crew , which actually consists of young woman working the register and whatever cook they were able to get to work later , is terrible ! The girls are clearly not open to learning anything which has made me refrain from ordering after 6-7 pm , unless they're still outside . I even had one instance where I called in an order , went and picked it up & paid with my card , just to find out the next day that the girl gave herself a $5 tip! Like ... wtf .. regardless they fixed it the next day but the point is W T F . Lol . Anyway , if you're in the area and you see them on the grill , STOP ! You won't be sorry"

Everything from linens, to utensils and servers was taken care of. That was a huge help considering that I was planning the wedding from across the country.

She listened to my vision and gave expert advice for the menu, venue set-up, decorations, and party help.  For the next two months she  stayed in touch with me refining every detail and getting back to me (sometimes instantaneously) whenever I had a question. Yesterday Roxanne was there making certain everything was nothing short of perfect and stayed well beyond what she should have to make sure the party flowed well.

(And that was even before it started, so of course Murphy's law, it started late which made their timeline to accommodate their staffing that much worse) \nWhen pressed about it, the owner wanted us to take more time off work to meet with their staff about it. Uh, wtf? How about just apologize for not meeting expectations and not being able to fix our wedding day. \nI picked this vendor. \nI picked the menu. \nI paid for it. \n\nThe only reason they get any stars is because our guests said that what they did get tasted good- but the portions were stingy and stations including dessert were not refilled. \n\nWe didn't get our couple meal to go or our leftovers that we'd previously requested.\nWe didn't get the wine we didn't use for our toast back. \nTheir staff told my guests that they don't normally eat at events bc people always order the same things but our menu was different and they enjoyed our food. \nMy mom saw their staff with trays of food to go, these same people claimed they gave that food to her. \n\nIt was the most regrettable part of\nmy wedding day/weekend since we had to return home to feed the guests we planned to leave the leftovers with. \n\nI, as the bride- spent 12k on this caterer and have no idea how the food at my wedding was and they didn't care enough to even apologize.\n\nJust a whole headache, and I should have called the other 2 preferred vendors at my venue. I could have paid a lot less and left with the same level of dissatisfaction. \n\nI had high hopes for future events with them, but clearly that won't be happening. \n\nPs. Always check your final invoice against your original contract and any payments- a week before my wedding I had to send back the invoice several times and explain why it was wrong on multiple levels -  how you gonna send someone a final bill (after deposits) where the amount due is higher than the original contract amount for the whole event. And have the nerve to insist that it is correct (it wasn't, it was all wrong) \n\nJust, ugh! Save yourself the headache and avoid! \n\nFYI- if you use them for a wedding, the bakery they use for the included wedding cake is way out in chestnut hill PA and they only serve pound cake. (It wasn't anything special)"

It's usually $25-30 for a large cake and party guests always love them. You can also buy by the slice, 3 layers of moist, fruit covered, authentic tres leches yumminess for ~$2. My husband and I have stopped in after dinner a couple times just to get a slice of dessert on a budget. I also saw some local contractors go in and order tamales - the woman behind the counter went over to a large steam pot and pulled them out fresh. I was sure to get these next time and they were just as good as what you'd get at a trendy mexican place and were ~$1.50 each! There were multiple kinds mixed in the pot, I gladly took whatever kind she pulled out first. Friendly people, very little english."

Maybe it wasn't that fresh and had got soggy in the meantime?  2.5 stars.\n\nHorn-shaped thing filled with custard: NOT good.  Pastry/bread part was dense -- I was expecting something lighter and flakier.  Maybe that's just the style of the dessert.  But, the custard is disgusting -- it tasted fake, like it came from some cheap package of powder.  I usually love custard, but I did not want another bite of that thing.  It's headed for the trash can.  0 stars.\n\nI'm giving this place 2 stars for the mille-feuille.  Usually, I'd average the two ratings, but I feel bad giving 1 star for such a small place when I've only tried 2 things.  Maybe they have other desserts that are better.  Just stay away from the custard."

I opted for the tres leches cake because that's what I had been craving first, but I was prepared for disappointment. The slice looked dry but I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt.

After reviewing all the options- based on looked alone- I selected a muffin like item topped with chocolate and sprinkles. The muffin, like all of their baked items, was huge and easily shared among two people. \n\nThe muffin came to a $1.50, less than I expected. After taking my first bite I discovered it was corn muffin- not something I would have originally picked- but it was surprisingly good! \n\nI'm making it my goal to try all of their mystery baked goods- I'll keep Yelp updated on the progress."

There was no one by the trailer so we go to the concession and the guy seemed kinda off put by the fact that we were there and didn't seem to of known we were coming. He opens up the trailer and fishes out two beach cruisers and we had to tell him we paid for three and he then proceeded to tell us that he didn't have another one but he had a mountain bike. We were like okay? He pulls out this rusty mountain bike that looked like it was on its last leg and that's when we just had to say we needed a refund because that is not what we paid for. They told us to text the number we had called them on a picture of our confirmation and that we were requesting a refund. Hopefully we will get our money back. Do not recommend. Maybe if they had bikes that actually worked and also something so simple as a sign letting you know where to go that advertised their services they would make some more money."

Though to be honest, we only did try the fried rice from the dinner combos.  Maybe its better if you didn't get it from a combo but order it as a meal?\n\nThe style here is NY takeout but their way of cooking the meal is definitely different than other Chinese Takeout places.  The fried chicken wings are small.  The general Tso's chicken chewy and not as good as other take out places I've tried.  \n\nWith that said, what stood out here is the soup.  The Egg drop and the hot and sour soup are incredibly delicious.  Probably one of the better tasting ones I've had.  Lots of flavor, I was surprised how much flavor the egg drop soup has.  Because it is such a simple dish, I didn't expect much from it.  I mainly stick to ordering the soups from here now.  \n\nI'll probably continue getting food from here since its in the area.

I ordered hot & spicy beef off of the dinner combo menu which came with fried rice, an egg roll and I chose hot & sour soup. I don't think I've ever seen hot & sour soup as an option on a combo menu before and it made me so happy because that was exactly what I wanted. They also let you customize your level of spicy and since I like to burn my face off, I asked for extra spicy. It did not disappoint at all!!! Very tender beef, super flavorful sauce, great amount of food. All for $11 and ready in 10 minutes. The gentleman who took my order was so kind and efficient.

Our server was rude and rushed everything, never asked us how our meal was even though we didn't eat it. we were very disappointed and ended up eating dinner down the street at blue corn (fabulous) . We won't be going back. Super sad that this place has no interest in people actually eating there"

This is a very simple dish that I've eaten hundreds of times over the course of decades of travel and these were exactly as I remember. Order more food if you're hungry. These come 4 to an order with red & green salsa. The red is \"hot\". \nBYOB & cash only. Im looking forward to a deeper menu dive."

It was a block from the famous cheesesteaks of Pat's and Geno's. This was a no brainer first experience. I shall be back! Hopefully next time I will be in line in the wee morning hours at Christina Martinez's famous South Philly Barbacoa (the sister restaurant). \n\nBy the way, you WILL pleasantly be greeted by Christina who is shuffling between her two master piece restaurants.

I ordered the red mole chicken that came with rice and beans and it was unique and the the thigh was moist! It came with corn tortillas to assemble tacos which was a messy endeavor but enjoyable. Mi esposo ordered chicken taquitos which were quite good as these us usually tend to be very dry with shredded chicken but these were moist. Best I've had? No, but better than most. The service was excellent and they do accept card. Recommend for anyone looking to find authentic Mexican food rather than the usual tex-mex most Americans are used to."

Went here for lunch outdoors during COVID; have a nice outdoor seating area that's covered with well spaced out tables; hand sanitizer available on each table and heat lamps lights above the tables for chilly days. Service was fast, but our server was a little terse and not very welcoming. We ordered guacamole and chips which was good; also had the chicken tacos dorados (three in our order but I believe the menu says four, which we didn't notice until later) which had a nice crunch and flavor but a little dry on the inside. Delicious and sweet horchata water. We've also tried the tamales which are average. TIP: the corn tortillas from this restaurant are some of the most authentic that I have found in Philly; they are handmade and sold by the dozen. Another tip, bring cash; there is no signage mentioning that they only accept cash."

The structure or building stick out like a sore thumbs. It is practically across the street from the Bensalem Police Department. It sits between the Polish American VFW and the first Elementary school of Bensalem. It is north on 95, get off at the Street Road exit, continue up Street Road to Knights Road, turn right on Knight's and if you cross By berry; then you went to far.\n\nI am the token White guy at the Temple. There is another white couple who are just friends, I never talk to either one of them. I know all the monks and regulars. I go to the Temple more then I go to visit my Father or brother. For me it is a very relaxing place. My Thai is not as good as it should be But I have been immersed in the Thai culture for over thirty years. I been to Thailand twice, live in a Thai commune for five years, while stationed in Germany.\n\nWill you get the Thai experience? Yes, somewhat; even though the majority of the \"Thai\" people that go there are friendly and educated, Thai's are shy by nature. But if you smile to them, they will smile back. If you show an interest and respect in their culture, they will more then happily be willing to show it to you.\n\nI truly love the Thai food that they make there and it is truly better then the Thai restaurants around the Philadelphia area. But be advise, the food here is made for the Thai's who come to pray. The food is not Americanized, like at the local Thai restaurants do. If you ask a Thai or me, if  is it spicy, we will tell you the truth whether it is or not. No one wants you to get sick and have a bad experience. Sunday lunch is open to the public and a small donation of $5 or $10 would be appreciated. Also Thai's do not use chopsticks when eating, it is more preferable to use a fork and spoon. I am a big fan of \"sticky rice\", served in a wicker bowl. But I recommend eating the regular rice, till your stomach get use to it.\n\nAny diary product will counteract the spicy taste in Thai, Loa or Cambodian food.\n\nWomen should not ever touch the monk, wear V-neck or any top that would show their cleavage.\n\nThe Monks chant in Bali, not Thai. But usually give sermons is Thai.   ."

My friend who is very world traveled was quite pleased the way the place offered a place for Thais to congregate.  It was a very welcoming place and I exchanged a few greetings using my limited Thai language skills.  My friend has a german wife and appreciates other cultures and things like Polish American Clubs, or whatever groups are involved.  I also that year while working in the New Jersey area was able to see the Dali lama who was lecturing at Lehigh University.  Just a beautiful year.

There wasn't a lot of pepperoni but there was a lot of steak (my friend got a pizzasteak which didn't have a lot of steak) and they put their cheese on the top of the sandwich. Everytime I took a bite, my cheese, ketchup, and pickles kept spewing out over the top making a mess. The steak itself wasn't bad, finely chopped and lean (main complaint with most places is chomping on chunks of fat but Francesco didn't have that problem). Roll was nice and soft.

I ordered a Steak, Guido Fries, and a Burger Combo, only one of which managed to impress. Suffice to say people didn't lie, there is certainly some room for improvement.\n\nI want to start on a high note, its rare for a pizza shop to sling a solid burger, but i give credit where credit's due. Francesco's burgers are solid, served with lettuce a la carte, self assembly, the way its meant to be, bun's are toasted up nicely, which is rare in the area, meat itself was decent, looked like it came from a supplier judging by shape, but, tastes like some decent home cooked beef. Cheese was also decent, and they gave a generous portion, no single Kraft single's BS. The fries served with the combo were also decent, desperately needed some salt, but after that they were pretty good. Texture was lacking, no stiffness or crisp to speak of but the flavor was definitely there.\n\nThe steak itself was okay, nothing  to write home about but pretty decent. Id say its in the upper-middle rankings as far as northeast Philly local shops go. Issue being the sandwich was more bread than meat, some of these bites were 60% roll in the center, and that feels chintzy, if they fix the roll's would be a lot better of a value proposition.\n\nGuido Fries were a wholehearted disappointment, it sounded good, it really did but there was very little seasoning, and /whatever/ that concoction it was smothered in, had zero flavor. The lackluster mayo pulled away from any seasoning that may have been placed on the fries, and drudged the whole experience down. Not to mention the lack of crispness was only made worse by the watery smothering.  Methinks not, not ever again.\n\nBurger was legitimately good, steak was middling with the bread issue, and the Guido's?  TERRIBLE. Suffice to say i have mixed feelings, maybe some other stuff on the menu is actually great, maybe they should call them Francesco's Burger's, i don't know, but i want to give benefit of the doubt and try again- just...not those Guido fries.\n\nFlavor & Presentation 2/5   |   Speed & Service  3/5   |   Pricing & Portions  3/5\n\nOverall  2.66/5"

One of the few positives is they are one of the ONLY places in my area that are open very late, and will also deliver, usually until about 1:30am.  The quality of the ingredients used in most of the items are of such low quality, and it looks like they try to compensate for that by serving somewhat larger platters(than most places), which some may see as a positive, but what good is having a $/-/i T ton of terrible food?  If you are intoxicated and stumping around the area early and are looking to stuff your face without notice to the taste, by all means!

They have a good selection of sandwiches and sides--some of the sides look incredible, in fact, like the marinated artichokes--and are very reasonably priced. They have a Subway-ish model of service, where you order a sandwich, they start to assemble it with pre-packs of meats, and then you point out which toppings you'd like on it. \n\nTheir Italian hoagie is not too bad, with mediocre bread (a little too soft), and decent meats. My main qualm is with their hot pepper selection. You can opt for jalapenos, which are hot but not right for an Italian hoagie, or their hot pepper relish, which is oddly sweet, in a gherkiny kind of way. \n\nThat said, they are vastly superior to the other options in the station, and I've never had a bad experience here."

Man, they do make huge, \"small\" subs. My order came out to $6.97. \n\nMy take: The turkey was standard processed turkey, a bit on the bland side. The tomatoes and onions though, were fresh and yummy, as I am a big fan of both veggies. Overall the bread was very good, and the sandwich was good for it being tasteless processed turkey. Subway's processed turkey tastes better than this place.\n\nI have yet to try any other meats there, but if I were you, I'd skip the turkey. I'm only judging this place on the meat/sandwich I had on this visit. I heard good reviews on the Italian sub, so I'll try it again, however on the way from SEPTA I saw another place that uses Boar's Head meats in 30th Street, so I might not return to this place again (Old Nelson Food Company- haven't been there, but will go because of the Boar's Head brand being there)"

Ummm I know butter is expensive but when you are paying $20 for a platter it should be automatic. If it's not butter change the menu. You only get a half an ear of corn. The food was luke warm.

Is this one any better? Absolutely! The new owners nearly nailed the complimentary tortilla chips. The chips were thick and crunchy (house made from cut corn tortillas). Unfortunately; management missed the mark on the salsa which was too sweet (think Ragu) and suffered an apparent overdose of chili powder. My guest ordered the combination fajitas while I ordered the steak burrito. I was the unlucky one. The chicken on the fajitas was outstanding. Tasty tenderloins properly seasoned with lime and garlic. The steak was sliced strips of skirt marinated in a garlic based dressing. The protein portion was extremely generous. My only real complaint is the vegetables were a little undercooked.  My burrito was a huge 14 inch Tortilla filled with everything else other than meat. Lots of beans, rice and undercooked veggies. At least the refried beans were good. Chunky. Not your typical runny. The prices appeared to be in line with nearby mom and pop Mexican establishments. Sadly; as of 3 Saturday's ago, they don't have any lunch menu yet. They say they're working on it. I'm not so sure. I may return to sample other items on the menu but I'm surely not going to pay $12.00 for one lunch."

The cheese dip was ok.  \n\nThe menu is very abbreviated and although the choices are limited they all cost about the same price (between $8-11). Some items come with rice and beans, most do not.  \n\nI ordered the asada tacos because I really wanted Mexican rice and it was a dish that it came with.  While the steak was cooked to perfection I was given no condiments for my tacos (sour cream, pico, shredded cheese, etc). The mexican rice, however, was utterly disgusting.  It was gross Chinese buffet rice meets Mexirice.  There were green beans, carrots, peas, and corn in it.  So disappointing.  Refried beans were decent.\n\nMy husband ordered the Mariachi burrito.  Its a cheese covered burrito stuffed with chorizo, potatoes, rice, and beans.  It was HUGE and tasty.\n\nBoth our children (not connoisseurs by any means) ordered chicken tenders.  Both kids said they were too dry.  \n\nThe restaurant was clean, staff incredibly friendly.  Overall not a miserable experience, but I definitely won't be back."

They started me out with chips and salsa fit for gringos like myself crisp chips snd salsa was not too hot. The tacos were served on a big cutting board with rice. Although they put peas in the Mexican rice, they were easily removed. The Pastor was best with juicy chunks of pork and Pineapple which I have come to love.  The Asada was also excellent. The carnitas was unremarkable but passable and al three were complimented by a  nice Verde that was not too\nHot but left a pleasing burn on the palette that did not last too long. Friendly service.

I received a confirming text and email saying my order would be ready at 4:50 pm.  On the way, I got another text saying the order would be ready 10 minutes later- no big deal.  When I got to the restaurant, the staff had no record of my order.  I showed them the confirming email and texts.  They apologized and said my order would be assembled at put togetherness 5-10 minutes.  There were others who were waiting for a while well.   Then there was 15 minutes of chaos- 3 staff members trying to get orders, then disappearing.   I finally saw what looked like my order being put in a bag and then later stapled.  The bag sat there while other orders were filled and no one paid attention until I called it to their attention and it was indeed my order.  By then it was close to 5:30 pm 25 minutes after the 5-10 minutes I was told. I also noticed while I waited that the app had sent me an email saying my order was ready.  I understand ordering app issues- it was their app. What made this difficult was the lack of anyone taking charge to make sure orders were being filled.

But, I will admit that the menu initially intimidated me. None of the dishes were familiar to me. Even though there were English translations for the names of each of the dishes offered, I still found myself standing in front of the order counter Googling what each dish traditionally included.\n\nI knew that I had a soup craving when I came in here, and I am so glad that I settled on the gamja-tang. The pork rib broth soup was so rich and flavorful, and it included some delicious, big, meaty pieces of pork on the bone. The potatoes and other vegetables inside the soup were also very flavorful and cooked to perfection. The seasoning was just right with this dish!\n\nI didn't know that I would also get a side of white rice, kimchi, and other small container filled with what appeared to be some type of bean. All of these little additions were excellent to eat with my soup. And as an added benefit, my meal that was close to $13 really turned out to be two or three meals given the amount of food provided. I enjoyed the soup again when I reheated it the next day. Still so full of flavor and rich. I would certainly come back to try some of the other menu items."

What kind of food business closes at 7 first of all and if so, why did she take the order at 6:30 if she was that desperate to close at 7 sharp. I felt so uncomfortable and wanted to leave but here, you pay first before you eat so she can make it to-go but would not issue a refund. So it was eat in 20 minutes or eat in the car. I wish she could have at least mentioned it before I made payment. I really miss the original owner. This used to be our go-to spot but the quality and service went to trash. The price is reasonable but it is not worth to bear the horrible customer service. If you love eating in 20 minutes while someone awkwardly stare at you, you have found \"the\" place!

Different Korean restaurants have different styles on making Korean food. Manna Kitchen is very unique in that aspect. The bulgogi is something new other than the traditional marinade that other Korean restaurants have to offer. It is mixed in with a entirely different sauce which is one of the most delicious delicacies I've had in a while. The tonkatsu, budae jigae, bibimbap, and other dishes are worth trying. One of the hidden attribute of this Korean restaurant is its ability to make fried chicken! The fried chicken is extremely delicious and in my opinion way better than the likes of local philly favorites: SOHO and Bonchon. The setting is a small old fashioned mini restaurant where the prices aren't extremely outrageous. You can also shop at HMart while you are waiting for your food. If you are dining in you can request extra side dishes such as kimchi at no expense! Just make sure you come in on time before closing where the food will be at it's peak. It's proper etiquette to show respect to the hours as this place and any other restaurant like to close early. I'm here at-least once a week to go eat and in my experience I have dined once during after hours. I was not told to go eat in my car nor told to hurry up as a previous review has said. If you actually eat out a lot you should know it's best to dine in way before closing to get the best experience. I wholeheartedly recommend this place as the food will bring peace to your soul."

There are only four tables, so takeout is the primary focus. I stopped in yesterday to check out their Korean Fried Chicken, which comes six pieces to the container for nine bucks and change. \n\nTo be transparent, we seemed to have a small miscommunication about exactly what I was getting. I asked for Korean Fried Chicken Wings, which I thought the friendly order taker agreed I could have. Instead, what I got were a few wings and a majority of thighs. Now, I like thighs, but they are not the same as wings in taste nor texture. So, when I arrived home my first impression was that I had received huge wings. First bite told the tale, and disappointed my taste buds. The crisp was there, as was the delicious ginger soy finish, but the taste of the dark meat chicken could not be mistaken. \n\nI am willing to chalk this confusion up to poor ordering on my part, rather than intentional misdirection by the staff. I did enjoy them once I realized what I had, it's just that my expectations were left unmet. This accounts for the loss of a star. After all, meeting expectations is what satisfaction is all about, and thus, reviews reflect that reality. \n\nStill, I will get back to Manna sooner or later to see what else is going on. I do hope for no more misunderstandings, and that the chef is wearing her mask at all times while handling food, which accounts for the second demerit."

We went with our old standby, butter chicken, just to get our toes wet and test the waters a bit. Along with the entree, we also got garlic naan bread, vegetable samosas, and stuffed bread pakora. I've never had or heard of stuffed bread pakora before, and let me tell you, I am SO happy I tried it. It's two pieces of bread stuffed with kinda the same mixture as the samosas and breaded with a chick pea batter then fried. Wowie!  It's a carb lover's dream!!  The naan bread was top notch. It was soft and fluffy, not tough, chewy, or burned like has been my experience lately with another Indian restaurant. The samosa wrapper was light and crispy, and the filling was on point, not too spicy but definitely not bland. The other Indian restaurants around here seem to have ones from the frozen section at Costco. Lastly, the butter chicken:  oh my gosh!  Delicious!  The chicken was tender and not dry, the sauce was fantastic, and the basmati rice was cooked to perfection. We got our food for takeout, and the appetizers came in this cute little paper box instead of styrofoam, which I appreciate because I don't like hot bread items in styrofoam. They end up getting all soggy, not to mention styrofoam is terrible for the environment and is filled with chemicals that could possibly leech into the food. Warning:  If you call to place an order, they might not answer right away. I think there was only one person working the front of the house and taking phone orders. I called three times and almost gave up. Luckily, I called back and got someone to answer on the fourth try. Not a big deal, just wanted to let others know. Overall, Mela knocks it out of the park and I'm so happy to have a new Indian restaurant option on the south side!!!"

The starter is a very thin crisp with a \"salsa\" that is to die for. Think of it as Indian chips n' salsa.  The appetizers that we chose were chicken samosas and the paneer. The samosas were amazing and were accompanied with a wonderful sauce.  The paneer was ok, but worth the try! We followed up the apps with Butter Chicken, Mango Wala (chicken), Tandoori Lamb Chops, and Lamb Kolhapuri.  All dishes were served with the traditional rice and mixed greens.  The flavors are amazing and the meats were so amazingly tender.  The wait staff is very patient and willing to assist in helping you make the right choice.

Papadum and a green cilantro chutney is given as a free app (think chips & salsa at a Mexican joint). For an appetizer, my wife and I shared the allu tikka chat, which is 2 fried, spiced potato patties on a bed of chana masala, along with some very tasty chutney; more than enough for 2 people. For my main entree, I picked the Vegetable Korma which came loaded with all sort of veggies and beans (cauliflower, potatoes, peas, peppers, zucchini, onions, paneer, chana). Everything was cooked perfectly and piping hot and fresh. I'd have to say that this is one of the better kormas I've had around Indy, or anywhere for that matter. My wife got the Chana Saag, which is a spiced pureed spinach/greens gravy along with garbanzo beans, tomatoes, and potatoes. Again, very fresh and hot, and absolutely delicious. The chickpeas were cooked quite well, and were soft just like they should be. The basmati rice was cooked with cumin seed and possibly a hint of other aromatic spices to enhance its flavor a bit. The garlic naan was fantastic! Had a little bit of browning/charring but was still soft and chewy. For dessert, we got the gulab jamun (always hard to pass up!). Temperature was hot, which I prefer, the syrup was light and had great aromatics, and they also threw in some coconut shreds which added a nice element. \n\nThe restaurant itself is quite new and looks great. The d\u00e9cor is comfortable and inviting, and the entire place was extremely clean. Great atmosphere all around. They did a great job turning an old Sears building into this beautiful restaurant. The bar area is spectacular and they have a ton of high quality liquor and spirits.\n\nOverall, we highly highly enjoyed our visit to Mela.

We ordered the Aloo Gobi, which is a stir fry type cauliflower dish as well as the Milagi Khozi Chettinad which was a Chettinad pepper chicken dish. They were both delicious but the chicken dish was the star. Honestly I've never experienced clove used so well in a curry. Absolutely fantastic and it had a perfect heat level that built and subsided quickly. We had their fresh papadan as well and one of their stuffed Naan bread options. Both fantastic. I love Papad so I'm always happy when it's offered. Finally we ordered the Pani Puri and a strawberry lassi. Those two items I wouldn't necessarily recommend. The Pani was okay but awkward and the sauce was in a styrofoam coffee cup which just felt cheap.

This restaurant from start to finish, was an experience to say the least. Each new thing I tried, the chutney with the appetizer, the lentil soup, the chicken tikka masala, was packed with so much incredible flavor, I'm blown away, more than I ever have been by a restaurant, it inspired me to sign up to Yelp to leave this review.\n\nIt's brand new so I was the only one dining in. I hope more people can try this hidden diamond and keep it running.\n\nThe ingredients and spices you can tell are all fresh and top notch. I just hope they keep up the amazing quality in the long term.\n\nUpdate 5/26/21: I went back recently and sad to say had a much different experience. I ordered the exact same thing as my first visit I raved about.\n\nFirst the free appetizer gave a good indicator, the green chutney was not nearly as fresh and popping with flavor as before.\n\nThe lentil soup had a very foul taste to it, and lacked the seasoning the first one had.\n\nAnd for the chicken tikka masala, the chicken pieces were cut so big that they were not bite sized, and they too had a strange flavor. The tikka masala gravy was just normal, like other Indian restaurants, It did not have the same impressive seasoning it did the first visit.\n\nSo sad to say it seems they've already had to start cutting corners to save costs, be it use less seasoning/spices or using non fresh ingredients. \n\nBased on my first visit they were number 1 of all Indian restaurants near the southside. Now, of Clay Oven, Tandoori Flame, and Mela, if they continue on this path I would rank Mela last among the others now."

What kind of place brags about running the best authentic soda shop with milk shakes charges a hefty free for milkshake with no whip cream or cherry?  Chick-fil-A makes fresh handspun milkshake with bits of Oreo cookies, topped with whipped cream and a cherry, size large for $3.45!\n\nFirst and last time we will order togo from your place."

You can imagine how sad I was when I went to order last year only to be told by a recording that they had left that location.  I then spent the next year wandering Edmonton like Kung-Fu, except instead of finding people to help, I was in search of a replacement goto pizza place.  I tried many places on the Southside, from chains to small independents and found everything lacking.  Once you've had Grandma's, all the rest are just pedestrian pie.\nThen(!!!) about 2 months ago, I got home to find a menu wedged into the frame of my front door.  Even walking up my sidewalk, I could see the familiar face of Grandma on the menu.  At first I assumed my friends were playing a cruel trick on me - knowing my love of Grandma Pizza and the fruiltless seach I had been on (oh, how I complained out loud at any mention of pizza), I figured they had either found an old menu or printed a bogus one up, and planted it on my front step just to tease me.  But it turns out.....dramatic pause while we listen to the angels singing from above....Grandma Pizza had reopened!!!!  Sure, it was a bit more of a drive from Petrolia to Riverbend, but I was more than willing to make the journey.  Was I trepidatious and worried as I drove there?  You bet!  What if someone just took over the name and was serving the same old shopping mall outlet by-the-slice-heated-under-light-bulb junk?  What if the move from Petrolia to Riverben had somehow damaged the original pizza oven and it lost its magic!?!?\nRest assured!  I'm here to tell you that the new location is serving up the same pizza that was offered at the original location - and it is still THE BEST PIZZA IN EDMONTON.  Every few weeks, I gladly make the short drive down the Whitemud to fetch my Grandma and she's as great as she always was."

Its elusive to say the least.  Thankfully, Grandma Pizza in Riverbend fits the bill, and does so handily.\n\nThis isn't New York pie: the crust is robust (thankfully not quite at the lasagna level that Whyte Avenue's Chicago Deep Dish Pizza provides), the sauce is sublime: it's not just tomato sauce but the spices are subtle.  And the toppings?  VERY generous and always fresh.\n\nThankfully, Grandma delivers all the way to Laurier Heights from their location in Riverbend, and I'm always more than happy to be generous with the delivery person: they are bringing a bit of Edmonton magic every time they show up.  Forget the corporate pizza places and go with an E-town original next time you're craving a pie ... it's worth every penny and then some!"

I've never complained about take out before but given this was $26.85 and not edible, just needed to share.\n\nAlthough excited to try you out, the preparation of the food was just not good.

We were both craving some pizza & wings and probably would have been satisfied with even just average product. This wasn't remotely close to average. \n\nThe large Pepperoni/onion pizza was severely undercooked, and we think they just tossed a few red onions on the pizza after it came out of the oven because they didn't taste cooked. \n\nThe \"deep dish\" pizza simply isn't deep dish pizza. They basically just use a thicker though. It was horrendous. Severely undercooked and just a messy/sloppy pile of dough, sauce, cheese. \n\nThe wings were good size, and probably the highest quality product we received but were still fatty, undercooked, and the \"hot sauce\" would be considered mild in any respectable wing restaurant. \n\nOverall, just an extremely bad experience and I couldn't recommend avoiding this place strongly enough."

This time was better - pizza was excellent, veal parm was very good and incredibly tender.  The so-so, spaghetti noodles on side were over cooked, garlic knots had very little garlic flavor and were dry (could use more butter).  Disappointing is that they did not get either order correct - first time they sent home the wrong food.  The second time ordered garlic knots and mozzarella sticks and ended up getting two orders of garlic knots and no mozzarella.

The grits were tasty but I wished they were a little more creamy. I think they were regular cheese and not Gouda. I will have to try to get the Gouda ones next time.  \n\nThe showstopper was the lobster tail. The batter was crispy and tasty and somehow the lobster tail was sweet, tender and buttery. I could have just eaten this and been super satisfied! \n\nThe blue crab fries were good but a little spicy for me but I already knew that. The crab was tasty and it was a very good sized portion.

The server was very nice and polite, The owner is super kind as well. I felt very welcome at this restaurant.\n\nMy Aunt ordered Crab Rangoon for the table and DANG were those things stuffed! They were very tasty. \n\nI ordered the Pork Lo Mein and Fried rice. The Pork Lo Mein was loaded with yummy veggies and pork. The egg fried rice was awesome too! \n\nMy aunt recommends the Kung Pao Chicken and at a 6 of spicy (1-10) it was very good. \n\nAny time our drinks were getting low they asked if we needed anything else. We ended up with 3 free bottles of coffee before we left as they had a box marked \"free coffee\". My aunt was given one and then the owner brought 2 more over for us as there were 3 of us. To top everything off the owner wa talking with us and walked with us and held the door for us as we left.

I've never had Crab Rangoon like this one before. They were triangles, and was stuffed full of the goodness inside. The breading was a sweet crunchy outside and soft and gooey inside, topped off with the sweet and sour sauce just made it all so good together.

We worked closely with Francine Burruezo and Robert \"Rob\" Spiars. \n\nThe venue is amazing, has been recently remodeled but it pales in comparison to the staff.  They had a member event in the AM, a child's birthday party, a member birthday party in the evening and still got everyone where they needed to be without issue.  \n\nThey made suggestions to make our event better and provided much help behind the scenes.  \n\nFrancine's smallest suggestion was listened to because of the expertise she displayed.   She was able to rely on wait staff, the dining and bar staff to execute her plan flawlessly. Her faith in their professionalism made us trust them to do their jobs.  \n\nRob managed the golfers and our lack of skill without a hiccup. Even when he was out of town he returned correspondence promptly and professionally.  As carts were returned from the Members event, they appeared clean and ready for our event.   Rob made sure Aaron and his other staff were aware of our first time organizer needs and took great care of our volunteers and guests. Rob personally updated scoring info into the evening to make it all happen just as the sun was setting.  \n\nAs soon as their work was done, they faded into the background so we could take all the credit.  \n\nThe wait, golf and kitchen staff were courteous, kind and provided endless help throughout the day.  Every time I turned around there was a neatly dressed Feather Sound Staff member helping out our volunteers and guests. \n\nThe Members as well were welcoming at every turn on the course or in the clubhouse.  \n\nIn all we raised much more funds for our charity due to the excellence of the staff and facility."

The golf course and pool are nice and the gym has everything you would need with a view of the pool and golf course.  \n\nWith your membership you must spend a set amount.  If you do not hit that $$$ amount then you will still be charged.  If you haven't hit your spending minimum then you can order steak or wine for home...Just don't forget or you will kick yourself when you get the bill."

The wine tasting, well more of a pairing happens the first Wednesday of every month. The cost is 25 dollars and man is it worth it. You get to sample so great food such as lamb lollipops and fresh tuna. As well as some awesome wines. The host talks about the notes of the wine and its origins with each bottle which is also available for purchase after the tasting. We also go the restaurant for some more wine and munchies.

                "text": "For many years, Feather Sound was home to the Chris Thomas Memorial Golf Tournament. Chris was one of the most popular sports television and radio personalities in Tampa Bay until his sad passing in 2004. \n\nI was fortunate to be an invited guest to play in many of those events, which help put Chris's daughter through college, and Feather Sound did a very nice job as the host. \n\nSince the property is a private club, I had rarely played in anything but charity tournaments until I was invited to play a leisurely round with my golf buddies from the Tampa Bay Lightning the day after Memorial Day weekend...when absolutely nobody else was out there on the course.\n\nFor that reason, our pace of play was wonderful. Condition of the golf course was very good in all facets. Greens were extremely fast and looked as good as they played. Also, the practice range, chipping green and putting green are quite nice.\n\nWhile there was no beverage cart on this day because we were basically the only group out there in the heat, the turn from the ninth green to the tenth tee features a convenient spot to stock up on snacks, Powerade, beer or free-poured spirits. (Nope. I don't drink on the golf course...although a shot of Glenlivet might have done us all some good on that second nine today.)\n\nThis is undoubtedly a second-shot golf course. I regularly hit most fairways here, but that guarantees me nothing on the scorecard. Most greens are elevated, a missed green is rarely an easy chip and putt and about half of these greens can be three-putted easily because of their size and shape.\n\nThe location of this golf course is one of its biggest positives, because it is just across the Howard Frankland Bridge from Tampa and the track works its way past a number of very nice homes in the Feather Sound development. Many players often find their way right across the street after the round to Courtside Grille to take the edge off a score they won't be bragging about the next day.\n\nWhile I choose not to be a member anywhere to keep my golf costs down and because I like playing a variety of courses, this would be my second choice right behind Carrollwood Country Club in the Tampa Bay Area. Both of them way ahead of overrated places like Avila and Palma Ceia."

First, the menu choices consisted of eggs, hash browns, bacon, a few pieces of sliced cantalope/honeydew and \"just defrosted\" tasteless pastries.   The \"scrambled eggs\" were like chunks of yellow brick with a green/gray color in middle of each piece! The bacon was barely cooked, the hash browns very salty, and the pastries freezing cold! UGH! Felt like I was at a college dining hall, or a cheap diner. The college girls could have made a much better brunch!\nIt was a total rip off for all the sorority girls' families that wasted the money and time to attend. Never again for this club!!"

I was interested in joining Feather Sound back in January 2021, but heard that they were going to close the course for ~ 7 months to renovate the course. Didn't understand why I should pay the $4k initiation fee to be relegated to other courses for 7 months.  Also, I know the course will not be in great condition when it does reopen; new greens are hard as rock, etc.  So, I looked at other clubs in the area and after 2 months I'm ready to make my decision on which club to join.  When I circled back with Feather Sound I was told that their initiation fee had now increased to $10k?!?!? AND they would not honor the initiation fee offered just 2 months earlier. They claim there is high demand to join and even a waiting list now?!  Wasn't one 2 months ago! The Membership Manager said that no one could make any adjustments to their initiation fees, won't even discuss the reasons for it?!  Very short sighted, lacking customer service or simple business etiquette.  BY THE WAY I LIVE ON THE GOLF COURSE?!  How many potential members could I bring with me or................ turn away?!  I think I know the answer!!"

Y'all already know I ordered the Lamb Chops. They were crazy flavorful and you could tell they were cooked at a great temperature. The plate came with two grilled . They were a great size, juicy and buttery. The mashed potatoes  were slamming aka amazing. They were topped with creamy seafood sauce.\n\u00a0\u00a0 I also tried a bite of the wrap. I will certainly will be ordering \u00a0that on my next visit. The bread had a nice grilled flavor, was still soft and that sauce was just perfect. It was rich, creamy, cheesy and full of seafood. The lobster  was also grilled nicely and seasoned even better. The fries  were crispy but the salad should have been put on the side. It was soggy due to the sauce from potato ran over. For me this was okay because the sauce is just that darn good, but for someone expecting a salad  to eat it would be a bummer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 MKM was very accommodating and pleasant.

I ordered the Patton's hot sausage breakfast ($8.00) and a 3-pc order of glazed beignets ($3.75). \n\nThe food and service were great. Other than the eggs, which had a box / govt. issued taste to them (I don't think they were freshly cracked eggs), the breakfast was spot on. The grits were creamy, cheesy and well seasoned. I think they add milk to their grits just like I do. I didn't have to add salt or pepper. They were delicious. Of course the hot sausage was sublime. If you're a native, you're familiar with Patton's reputation for producing a quality, almost irresistible product. Lastly, the honey butter biscuit was warm, fluffy and buttery. It's somewhat similar to a KFC biscuit. All that said, I don't know that it was worth $8. The grits were good, but it wasn't a lot of grits. The most expensive ingredient was the hot sausage. \n\nNext were the glazed beignets. I've been wanting to try glazed beignets ever since Antoine's debuted them. It seems more bakeries/eateries are adding this item to their menu. I had one as soon as I got back to my car and it was light, airy and not overly sweet. I could've used more sweet, though. I had another one when I got home, but by then it had become dense. Sooo, like a powdered beignet, these are best enjoyed when hot. \n\nThe location is very small. It can comfortably accommodate about 7 people; pandemic or no pandemic, it's tight. I'm curious who their target audience is because the price point of their signature dishes are out of range for many of the people in the surrounding neighborhood. I'll be back to try some of the heartier dishes like salmon, lobster and lamb chops."

We all tasted each other's meal three or four times.  My daughter hates red meat and ate almost half of my steak. The pasta was the house favorite. The lobster tail was a bit on the smaller side and, IMO, was not worth the extra $15.\n\nI'm giving a rating of four stars ONLY because there were three items on the menu that were not available, so I would advise to go early. \n\nOverall, I would and will definitely recommend this place to everyone that I know."

It only took about 15 minutes to make and it was as I had imagined it to be. I would definitely drive-in from Houston again just to get more of this food.

                "text": "Please avoid this place unless they make confirmed changes here. \n\nI had high hopes for this place as love these kinda Cajun crab boil places and been to a ton around the country but this experience was terrible. \n\nLet's start with the manager..very smug and rude. I called before hand and asked if they served alcohol and they said no, then I asked if we could bring out on beer, and they said yes. Very enthusiastically actually \"yes, of course you can!\"  So we did, sat down and my wife popped open her beer. But a min or two after the manager very loudly and very rudely came over and said hey I know you just opened that but you can't drink that here..we don't have our byob license yet. Please finish that one but don't open any more! I was like, well we called before and they told us it was fine and we could. Still he was very smug and the (white) manager was like \"well..they (nodding to the Asian staff at front desk) probably don't understand\". This kinda felt distasteful to me. If your the manager, take ownership of the issue and don't pass the blame. And the fact he was so loud and aggressive and not discreet about it with others around led to my wife and us feeling very embarrassed and put a total bad feeling on the meal. Def could have handled better. \n\nBut the worst offense was the food. It was like SO bland, zero seasoning and tasteless! So bizarre for this type of place and def the worst I've had at this type of place. I got the \"special\" which is a mix of all the sauces, so you'd think would be packed with flavor but was just oddly watered down, completely lacking in salt (or msg or whatever) and no flavor at all!! No chunks of garlic or taste of spice which is common at these types of places. I got the medium which was just not spicy at ALL. If this was mild I wouldn't have blinked an eye. I could forgive that but not the lack of seasoning. It seemed like they just boiled the seafood in plain unseasoned water, which was confirmed by a FB reviewer that spoke to manager who told him that's exactly what they did.  It didn't seem like the sauce was even cooked with or tossed properly in the sauce at all. It was just like...boiled tasteless seafood resting on top of bland sauce. So so disappointing! \n\nAlso minor pet peeves, had to ask like 4 times for some melted butter for my wife and kids to dip their crab in and only got it when they were 2/3 through meal. Didn't clear out our shell buckets when obviously full and we were still eating. Also the bags they used are very deep, much more so than any other crab boil place been too which made getting to the food very awkward. Again minor but just..weird. \n\nJust so you don't think this is a total hit job, the location is nice and the staff (other than douchey manager) were very friendly. And my wife and kids who just got  plain steamed seafood enjoyed (although did say lack of salt, but the seafood itself was cooked well at least to temp and texture if not flavor). \n\nSo maybe if you just enjoy very plain, low to no seasoned seafood you may like this. But to me the only reason to visit this sort of seafood boil place is for very flavorful Cajun seafood and this was so far away from that. And esp for the price (180 for fam of 2 adults and 2 young kids with tip but without drinks or ability to byo) for such an underwhelming and flavorless meal is borderline criminal. Def please stay away unless Crab Du Jour corporate can somehow get a handle on this location and make some quick changes. Otherwise predict a very quick demise of this restaurant sadly"

It was pretty slow when we walked in, but it was a Thursday before a holiday and 330p. We sat at the bar and the bartender immediately greeted us. He was quite fantastic during our whole visit. We ordered beer and wine and then the coconut shrimp and fried calamari. The food just fell flat - no flavor. For the coconut shrimp it was pretty much fried shrimp with some coconut flakes sprinkled on top. It was topped with some sauce, but it really should either be well coated or ideally served on the side. The calamari needed salt or some time of seasoning. \n\nTheir happy hour is pretty decent, so would go back for the drink specials, but maybe not for the food. Service was great and the host was really nice as we were leaving. Would give 3.5 stars if possible."

On the pick up side, everything was fast, pleasant, and oh-so easy.\n\nSat down in store to eat a piece or two and was pretty bummed to find that the chicken was not that fresh, plus there were chicken organs inside of the thigh pieces. I know maybe the freshness was my fault for walking over too slowly, but the chicken is definitely not suppose to have tiny brain looking pieces inside of it. Tweeted it to Popeyes and they told me that it wasn't normal and to reach out to customer service, but they never responded to me after that attempt. \n\nI'm usually a fried chicken lover, but I can't get over the thought of accidentally biting into a soft, lukewarm piece of brainy flesh.

The filling was incredible. Five star worthy in my mind. I found the arepa to be a bit too salty. Tone down the salt a bit, and Vamos becomes a five star joint.\n\nThe fried yucca was on point.

The tacos were double shelled and good they had a light guac topping...  The green and red topping salsas were good not the best but serviceable...\n\nThe shrimp taco too was loaded with flavor.  The Chipotle crema was a nice compliment and fresh limes for a squeeze......\n\nI will be back to try more items as I heard surrounding guests talking and it was all good...\n\nAtmosphere was light and breezy\nService by a very personable knowledgeable young lady named Mikayla, Was efficient..\nFood, coming back should say enough and the three tacos sufficed...\n\nEat Local, Shop Local, Live Local\n\n\nJC"

French toast was very flavorful which was surprising. Latte was with oat milk and was freshly brewed!

New items include chilaquiles that I was so close to ordering. \n\nWhen it comes to breakfast I am as basic as they come. I'm happy with eggs, a meat, toast & hash browns/home fries every time. Which leads me into the breakfast sandwich. Eggs with bacon & american cheese on chibatta. That chibatta was FRESH and delicious. Choose it. \n\nWe also had the mimosas- good but a tad heavy on the OJ for me...but I also would be happy with a out 2 drops of OJ. Pancakes with eggs & bacon. Pancakes were great! \n\nAs we were about to grab the check our server let us know they had chocolate croissants fresh out of the oven so obviously we had to try that as well! It was amazing. I'm a rene's girl for savory croissants but this was something I will be back for!\n\nAlso a ton of taco options, sandwiches and it looked like some peruvian food, if I'm not mistaken. They are open until 8pm so something for all the meals- not just breakfast!"

It's nondescript name offered all sorts of possibilities and come to find out, it's perfect for the restaurant. \n\nDad's Kitchen offers a variety of flavors, dishes, and types of meals. Peruvian in its roots, DK's main speciality appears to be traditional American breakfast. This is highlighted by the quantity of items on the menu and the bulk of its social media posts pertaining to the first meal of the day. However as I mentioned above, there's more than what meets the eye. The menu also has sandwiches, burgers, Mexican tacos, quesadillas, and Peruvian dishes. Picking up dinner there also presented me with an array of yummy looking dessert goods as well. \n\nMy experience with Dad's was a good one. I enjoyed talking to the owner while paying. The site is tastefully decorated and very clean. Most importantly, the food was tasty too. My wife and I had the fish tacos and the lomo saltado. The former of which was great! The latter was good, but not mind blowing. True to its name the saltado was a little salty but flavorful nonetheless. I think in the future, I would swap out the fries for something else, for I'm not sure how it complements the rice and meat. \n\nOverall, Dad's Kitchen is a great addition to the Broad Ripple neighborhood because it fits the mold of being family owned & offering unique specialities. It may be trying to put its eggs in one too many baskets, but it's new, it's the pandemic, and I think restaurant owners right now are doing what it takes to draw in as many customers as possible. I know personally I'll continue supporting this restaurant, and I look forward to witnessing how it it'll grow and evolve in the future."

I was recommended Agua Bistro by a friend and was impressed. The meal was excellent. My filet was one of the best pieces of beef I have ever had. It was prepared the way I ordered it cooked. The escargot was a tasty appetizer as well. My Wife had eggplant parmigiana and she throughly enjoyed it. The vegetables that were served with the filet were tasty and crisp. The mashed potatoes were excellent as well.\n\nTwo minor complaints I had was that the room was not comfortable. (No shades on the window and sun was shining on us while we ate.) and the waiter was inexperienced but he was trying his best.  We were offered a better table in another room by the hostess when we arrived,  but we opted for the warmer room. By the way, it was 97 degrees outside when we arrived.

It normally comes with baked chicken, but I paid $2 to upgrade to fried fish. The fish was maybe a smidge under salted, but better undersalted than over-salted, and it was otherwise good. The greens were good too, and I especially enjoyed the dressing and yams. My meal was roughly ~$14, which is really fair considering I'll be eating off of it twice. \n\nThe staff was friendly and my food was ready fairly quickly.

Usually, they are in Plant City or Lakeland. \n\nThe food is an interesting fusion of Hawaiian food and Taiwanese food. I ordered the HEFTY, which is Taiwanese beef with rice on a scallion pancake. It was an overstuffed Asian taco, and not very easy to eat. But the flavors were very good. The beef was well seasoned and reminded me of Taiwanese beef soup. It was topped with pickled veggies and some sriracha mayo. I could have done with less rice and more scallions in the pancake, but overall, I was  happy with my order. I also tried the haupia pie, which was awesome. It is a purple sweet potato pie topped with coconut and on a perfectly crispy crust. I found the crust too sweet (although I usually think things are too sweet), but otherwise, it was a great dessert. They also have a bunch of Hawaiian beverages, so my kids got some Aloha canned juices.\n\nFood is made to order, so expect to wait 10-15 minutes. \n\nI'd give the food a 4.5, but I'm rounding up because they are new. Serving sizes are generous. The owners are very nice and enthusiastic. I look forward to trying more of their food. Their General Tso chicken sandwich and XXL Ramen chicken look fantastic to me, but they also look like they don't travel well, which is a consideration when getting food to go."

Its just too good!\n\nHawaiian spring rolls have a perfectly crisp shell, filled with faintly smokey pork. The pork has a familiar taste, with a delicious pacific island flair.\n\nThe HEFTT is option you can feel good about eating. The rice, beef, scallion pancake and sauce will leave you satisfied without feeling like you need to avoid food and spend the next week in the gym. \n\nThe wings are awesome! Crisp, tender, juicy, fall off the bone kinda perfect. No extra sauces needed; eat as they are. Mild kick.\n\nThe Hangry Hawaiian is the best burger I have had in a really long time! And I am always on the lookout for great burgers. I had beef, topped with pork, bacon, jalepenos and pineapple. Its an amazing combo of balanced, sweet heat. I loved it! (The fries were also really good)\n\nThe haupia was a sweet, unexpected addition also. Its a buttery, graham cracker crust, layered with sweetened, purple sweet potato, the another layer of a coconut milk pudding.\n\nPlaces like this is the reason why I prefer food trucks and mom & pop spots over chains and big names. Happy Ending Food Truck lived up to its name. Good people, great food, big flavors! I will definitely be back for more!"

I have ordered a \"Hot and Ready Lunch Special\" only to be told \"We don't serve those after 2:00pm, 3:00pm\", \"We're out of them now\". And today I was told ( at 1:15pm) it would be 10 to 15 min wait. When I asked\" I thought you had them Hot n Ready\" I was told \"Oh, that's weekdays only\". \nSo, as much as I do enjoy Little Caesars pizzas, it seems I CANNOT ever get one at this location. \nGood luck trying to get the special."

It was the hottest, cheesiest and most meaty pizza that I've had from there in years. Pleasantly surprised and job very well done!!!!"

I stood waiting for someone to come to the front register and take the orders of the new arrivals like me. When no one came to the front after several minutes of waiting, I asked the others standing around if they had all been waited on yet. The second guy in line said he had been waiting for 20 minutes and no one had come to the front to take his order. \nI then observed that there were 3 employees making pizzas so I asked one of them if anyone was working the counter. A young man gave me a dirty look and walked to the front (his name was Tyler and he claimed to be the manager). He asked who needed to place an order. The woman at the front of the line spoke up and Tyler said \"she already waited on you\". The woman said the other girl looked at her on line order but never said if it was ready or when it would be ready and that she had been there long enough for them to cook it by now. Tyler told her \"It doesn't matter\" and moved on to the next person. I told Tyler that was no way to treat someone. They lady then addressed Tyler and said \"I wasn't being ugly I just want some information is all\" Tyler look at me and said I don't care. \nI told Tyler that if you don't care then just cancel my order. I don't want someone making my food that don't care. Tyler said fine I'll be with you in a little while. I then left the store to cool off cause I was pretty pissed by now. \nWhen I re-entered the store I asked Tyler if my order was ready and he said yes. I said I would just take the order instead of my money because my kids were hungry and I didn't feel like waiting somewhere else. Tyler said \"No. You wanted a refund so your getting a refund\". He then gave me a receipt and I left the store.\nI posted a complaint to Little Caesar's corporate web site but have heard nothing back. Tyler refuses to tell me how I can contact the franchise owner or the General Manager. \nI will never be back to Little Caesar's. I will buy frozen pizzas from Walmart and eat them cold before Little Caesar's ever gets another dime of my time or money."

Tuna was ok but wasnt cold as I expected.  They did sear it and cut it into tiny pieces.  The wontons were really greasy.  The sliders were sub par.  All pretty dry and plane.  The meat was smashed so thin all you tasted was bun.  The tzatziki sauce was dry like blue cheese.\n\nThe pam seared salmon was really good and I liked the sauce.  Rice was spot on too.  The veggie ham mix was almost all salty ham flavor.  No thanks.\n\nThe strip steak wasnt cooked that well.  They charred the outside and left the middle pretty raw for a medium rare.  Lots of stringy veins not rendered out.  The veggies were a soggy mess of butter and pepper.  And the mashed potatoes were the smashed variety and mostly butter flavor.\n\nThe carrot cake is no good either.  Tasted like it was frozen and recently thawed.  The middle had that frozen chill to it.  It was super dry and crumbly and the caramel sauce was really sticky and fake tasting."

I got an email notification when my food was ready and walked over to pick it up. \n\nThe new location is wonderful with a full display of pastries, a nice big wall menu, lots of indoor and outdoor seating just outside the restaurant, and a bank of self service order iPads. The food pickup shelf was easy to access and my meal was all packed up and waiting for me. It couldn't have been easier! \n\nNow, the food was as I remember. Fresh, tasty and relatively healthy. The portion size felt a little small for the price however. My bowl of soup was $8 and my friends salad was $10. I probably could have eaten both, no problem.

Everything was cooked to perfection and had a ton of flavor. \n\nThere isn't a ton of seating but they plan to expand into the space next door. I would definitely give this place a try!"

All the meats were great but my favorite was the tri tip followed by the salmon and then the chicken, pork belly was not what I expected as it was on the chewier crispy side but solid. My only complaint would be the amount of food for the cost. I remember getting my plate and thinking to myself there's no way because I could eat 2 of these plates myself easily it felt like I was paying tapas prices for a small handful of meats. The Parmesan Brussels were decent but too salty for me to enjoy . The broccolini was good with roasted garlic pieces and a nice ranch sauce. Everything was good but a bit on the smaller portion size , you could blow a pretty penny here trying to get full but I'd come back for another meal for sure ."

The sandwich was ample and the potatoes were just right.  The draft beer seemed a little small though- it might be an optical illusion using the small mason jars they serve it in. I really liked the solid chairs they had inside- too many places have flimsy furniture.  I'd give this four stars when they expand which I was told would be soon- it feels a little cramped right now, and the beer size, both of which distract from the star of the show- the food."

I told him no that would be 4 wings split in half and I need the other 8 wings that I ordered according to the menu of which he hung up on me. I returned the wings to the restaurant and asked him to explain how 4 wings magically becomes 8 and he said, it's 8 because the woman didn't split it in half to make it 8 and because I ordered my wings on the side it makes it a whole wing which would be 8 because it wasn't split in half. I told him that didn't make any sense and he told me that that's how it is and kept walking away as if he didn't care with hearing what I had to say and he laughed saying thats how all the restaurants do it. I told him I had never experienced that going to any other place and if I order 8 wings I expect to get 8 wings, of which he laughed and I told them I wanted my money back.\n\nI'll never order from here again, not only because I was being cheated out of my order but because who ever that male was that I spoke to, he didn't care to hear my concern or care to talk to me like I was worth hearing.

The kimchi was actually really good, surprisingly, not like uhmma's but you know.  Charcoal grill is always better so I hope more KBBQ get on it and open up some outdoor options.

The hostess was nice, our server was nice, but it's far from traditional and the flavors aren't quite there for most of the items that we've tried. I could be a bit biased only because I am Korean. \n\nDrink: Silk Road (comes in a fish bowl) not Covid friendly because it doesn't come in its own cups, literally a fish bowl with straws to be shared. The flavor was good but definitely diluted and not enough soju but it was good and refreshing! Someone posted that it was $28 but got charged $30. Our menu had the price at $38. So in a matter of 4 days they bumped the price an additional $10? \n\nFood - Appetizer:\n1. Dumplings - it was good, flavorful, good balance of the skin, meat, kimchi. \n2. Scallion pancake - it was okay, nothing special, just a typical scallion pancake. Portions small, not much flavor, not worth the price. It would have been better if they went with a seafood pancake instead. \n3. Pork gyoza - too much flour (gyoza skin was too thick), a bit undercooked, could taste the flour inside. It was okay. \n4. Fish (I forget the name) appetizer - it was light, refreshing, some of us thought it was a bit salty. \n\nFood - Meal: \n1. Kalbi - the best one but again lacked flavor, it was  way lighter on the soy sauce and the meat quality was good but it didn't seem marinated enough. Also not worth, I think they gave us 4 strips.. \n2. Flank steak - too much soy sauce and no other real flavor. Meat quality was good but disappointed in the flavor.  \n3. Bossam - I liked how they cooked it because traditionally it is just braised but it had a nice hard outer skin (similar to how Chinese and Vietnamese cook their pork belly). However, I didn't like how it had no meat, it was just all fat. Also it's supposed to come with oysters, cabbage, fermented marinated spicy radish to wrap it in, came with i think soy sauce (which was weird). \n4. Spicy pork shoulder - too salty and too much red pepper paste but it wasn't spicy and had really no flavor. \n\nThe banchan (side dishes), it was okay, nothing spectacular. Their potato salad and kimchi was probably the better ones. \n\nAll in all, my friends and I had a great time just being able to dine out and enjoy bbq but I probably wouldn't come back again. I was super ecstatic because Korean bbq on charcoal is seriously the best and there is only one place in philly where you can go for charcoal kbbq but the meat flavors just weren't fabulous that I'd crave it. However, they were very clever with how they set up the charcoal grills. It was a nice place to \"try\" but that's about it, nothing super negative but nothing so outstanding either, just so-so and pricey for the quality. I was hoping that their flavors were better because it's right in the city and that way i don't have to travel to north philly but the concept was good, service was standard and food mediocre. \n\nIf you want to give it a shot though, I'd say try the kalbi and dumplings. Their other cocktails sounded good too."

My boyfriend killed them right before they came onto our table. When we informed the server, the manager comped our $10 appetizer and said that our experience is the result of outdoor dining. We saw two more on the sidewalk as we exited. However, we have dined outside at Mission and Oyster House in the last week (both next door) and we didn't see one roach.

The hostess was friendly, our server was attentive, and they quickly cleared items that we were done with. \n\nFrom a food perspective, I was really hoping for something better - I love kbbq and have been to a ton of authentic places in the past. All of the food lacked flavor, and the cocktails seemed like they were mostly juice. We ordered the Kalbi - which was bland in flavor, and overpriced as they only give 5 pieces, so each piece was a little over $10...WILD. The banchan was \"soggy\" - I don't know how else to describe it, but there was definitely something very off in the flavor and vibrant element that banchan can bring to a Korean meal. \n\nMy biggest issue for the meal was the makeshift bbq that they provided. Our flame was way too hot and the heat was extremely uneven so that by the time the ends of the kalbi meat cooked, the middle burned. \n\nIt was a fine meal, but if you are looking for something authentic to the standards of taste that you are familiar with in a normal kbbq setting, this isnt the spot for you"

Anyway, my Korean husband wanted to give them a chance and try this place so we did. We travel everywhere (including South Korea) just to eat Korean food so we know what it's about. If you are looking for a non-authentic Korean restaurant then here you go.. yes, I said it.\n\nWe did appreciate the charcoal grill bc KBBQ just tastes better that way. The host, our server and waitress were nice and attentive.\n\nFried Chicken Wings - it's their take on Korean fried chicken and it was good\n\nSeoul Fashioned - it was okay, ginseng tea is pretty strong and didn't smell any of that on the drink\n\nGalbi - eek! The meat quality was not good (fatty) and the marinade just didn't do it for us - it was bland. It was pretty pricey as well\n\nBan Chan - kimchi was more fish sauce, the rest tasted more just vinegar-y, we did like the soy daikon and the lotus root. Sauces was just gochujang and soy sauce, nothing crazy. I don't think they do unlimited ban chans either but not an issue if you don't know \n\nculturally tone deaf things: the paper lanterns with cherry blossoms are not Korean, should be a hard NO. A couple of the cocktail names should be changed (ie: Chong Li) seriously? There are no Korean liquors/beverages either.\n\nNow if you don't know how to eat or haven't had KBBQ, you will be lost bc they don't explain what the ban chans were and what to do with that bowl of lettuce they just gave you.\n\nWe tried.. it's not for us.

Not as flavorful as one should expect for true kbbq (this is not actually a Korean restaurant). Hard to screw up fire and meat though. \n\nAlthough it's okay that the restaurant isn't managed/staffed by Koreans, it's clear that management (a very experienced group) has either not been thoughtful enough about running a restaurant that purports to be Korean or just couldn't care less and mashed up cultures that are close enough to Korean for them. The name, aesthetic, and menu items are problematic, yes. Worse though, is the apparent lack of understanding or hint of regret that the owners have demonstrated with regards to the public feedback they've received. \n\nNo doubt there are better authentic Korean restaurants in Philadelphia and neighboring towns (Upper Darby). If you want amazing Korean food, go to these places. If you want to feed the Schulson empire, try this place."

                "text": "I know there has been plenty of controversy about this place and it's appearance/theme, but I will aim just to review its food without delving into the cultural implications.\n\nOverall, I am a big fan of kBBQ and I would say as someone living in center city the options are not plentiful. I know there are a few more authentic locations (that I invite all to support and try out) but I for one welcome this addition to the center city food scene.\n\nFor a group of 3, we ordered 2 appetizers and 3 bbq entrees. This along with drinks for everyone was probably slightly more food than we needed but I would say that the biggest negative of this place is the expensive price and the quantity. 5 strips of kalbi short rib will run you about 40-50$; however I do understand things will be more expensive in center city. \n\nThe scallion pancake was doughy and unlike the fried crispy scallion pancakes we expected but we enjoyed them. We also shared the fried Mandu which was OK but nothing to get super excited about. \n\nIn terms of bbq, you get one charcoal grill and a choice of meats to cook it on. We ordered the bo ssam (pork belly), spicy pork shoulder, and the kalbi short rib. Of these choices, the bo ssam comes to you already cooked and the other two you cook on the grill. \n\nWith the meets you get an assortment of small plates (banchan). This includes traditional kimchi, scallions, carrots, lotus root, potato salad, corn, white kimchi, rice, lettuce. These are unlimited so be sure to ask for refills if desired. My favorites were traditional kimchi, carrots, and potato salad. \n\nOut of entrees, bo ssam is excellent; crispy skin with very fatty and tender pork belly. Goes great with lettuce wrap and some banchan. The kalbi was very tender with a sweet marinade but the only negative I would say about it is that it was a bit fattier than i would've liked for the price. Spicy pork shoulder has a nice taste and is much cheaper than the other two options we ordered. \n\nOverall, the ambience is fun, the charcoal grills are a nice touch and the food was enjoyable for people who miss going to kBBQ. Our whole meal for 3 people came to about 80-90$ a person and save to say we were stuffed by the end."

                "text": "Another spot run by vvhite folx who love to water-down traditional korean food to the vvhite palette, without consideration or respect for the culture they profit off of. Everything about this restaurant is problematic- from the name (splitting \"charcoal\" into one-syllabic characters to \"sound Asian\"), to the menu and decor- it's just plain cultural appropriation and disrespectful.\n\nLet's take a look at the menu and break things down- for one, the menu combines different words from both Korean and Japanese, but the restaurant is supposed to be Korean? Hamachi is not Korean- why would you take the language of Korea's colonizer and slap it onto a Korean restaurant menu? Consistency, at least, if you're going to bother trying to appropriate a culture.\n\nSecond- the chef is not even Korean, is that not the least you can do with a Korean BBQ joint? Sure, Rudofker may have worked with Chef David Chang, but that doesn't mean that he has spent any time really learning Korean cuisine and culture beyond work with a singular person. That, my friends, is tokenization. Just because he worked with David Chang doesn't mean that he is an expert or can craft Korean cuisine.\n\nThird- decor. Sapporo umbrellas- looks like they can't get away from this theme of conflating Japanese and Korean cultures. Now experienced KBBQ goers will know that KBBQ is synonymous with Cass, Hite, Kloud, Chamiseul, and Chum Cheorum- why is not a single Korean beer to be found on the menu?\n\nThe kimchi looks unripe and quite honestly like the vvhite man's uninspiring take on a historical staple in Korea, as does much of the other banchan. Put your money towards a different, Korean-owned small business that actually will do you the favor of eating delicious Korean bbq, a win-win in terms of cultural experience, good price, and real, delicious Korean food. Perhaps try Muta Korean BBQ, or Serabol (which is also right in center city, and owned by a proper Korean chef)."
            },
            {
                "text": "If you're going to say you're a Korean BBQ joint, you have to do kbbq justice. From the banchan, to the appetizers, to the meat itself, there's a certain level of quality I expect when I splurge for kbbq. Name-choice, decorations, what-ever controversy put aside, at the end of the day...Char Kol's food is very blah.\n\nPARKING: I hope you have better luck than I did. Ended up paying over $30 like a sucker to park in the garage right next to this area on Sansom street. This is definitely not a car-friendly part of Philly. Char Kol is located across the street from Oyster House and on a weekend, the outdoor seating areas are packed.\n\nEXTERIOR: The staff members were professional and attentive. Everything was clean and outdoors in these COVID-19 times. The use of an outdoor charcoal grill was something new to me from a kbbq place. Normally charcoal grilled kbbq is reserved for extended family outings at the beach for me. Be careful when cooking because food cooks really fast compared to your standard metal grill at the table.\n\nFOOD: We were told an order of meat comes to about 1.5 lbs. I don't think that's true. With three people, we ordered two orders of meat which theoretically should come out to 3 lbs. In my experience a 1 lb per person ratio should leave you absolutely stuffed. This was not the case and they try to make it seem like they give you a lot because they stretch their slices out on a large plate. The funny thing is that their menu says an order should feed 2+...maybe they meant birds?\n\n+Banchan: If you're looking for traditional, this ain't it chief. Their potato salad is the kind you find at the supermarket. Not heavily egg-based, lack of corn or cucumbers mixed it. Korean potato salad is sweet, not the salty/tangy American type. The kimchi was decent. The addition of pickled radish/carrot (a Vietnamese condiment) confused me. And again the LACK OF SESAME OIL (one of the pillars of Korean cooking) threw me off. Ya'll they don't even give you decent sauces to dip your meats in because all I got was overwhelmingly soy sauce-based.\n\n+ Scallion Pajeon: Actually liked this pajeon. It was crispy and flavors were authentic. Don't think the $11 price tag is justified. The only let down was the sauce that came with it. The sauce was very one-dimensional (a recurring theme here at Char Kol).\n\n+ Marinated Flank Steak: Liked this one slightly more than the spicy chicken breast. I didn't think the flavor of the marinade was very impressive. Where's the sweetness? Where's the umami? Because all I got was salt. Flank steak isn't a traditional kbbq cut. Wished they'd gone for more of a sirloin or rib eye cut. Save the flank steak for your fajitas. A bulgogi type of marinated meat would have been better.\n\n+Spicy Chicken Breast: Breast?? Choice of cut is again poor because breast is dry af, especially cooked over a grill. The flavor of the spicy marinade gave it more depth than the marinated flank steak. But chicken breast is not a good choice for bbq.\n\nDRINK: It has a more classy and youthful feel here at Char Kol. Unfortunately the cocktail drinks here are WEAK. I ordered the subak which is your traditional watermelon soju mixed with a Moscow mule. The watermelon juice aspect was nice, but for over $10 I expect a decent amount of booze in my cocktail.\n\nPRICE: Not worth it. For three people and some drinks, the bill was easily over $100. You can go to a legit AYCE kbbq restaurant for less than $30 per person. The underwhelming experience doesn't really justify the price. I don't mind paying a high price for quality BBQ and out of the many (many) Asian BBQ experiences I've had, Char Kol ranks pretty low on the list.\n\nOverall: It's a shadow of what kbbq is in terms of FLAVOR. It's kbbq I would expect if I didn't know what kbbq was supposed to taste like and I read everything from a travel guide. Call it kbbq for beginners *shrugs* or what it actually is, a Korean/Japanese fusion restaurant. You can market yourself as Korean/Japanese-inspired too, but at the end of the day the food has to wow me and it didn't at Char Kol."

No other customers were there till we left because it was around 3pm. We drive by this place everyday since my boyfriend lives near by, I'm glad we finally stopped though. Menu wasn't big but that's okay, it's better to not have so many options. Menu on the board must have been a special because there was a dinner menu they give you when you're seated. Their kitchen was the food truck outside of the building. We got steak tacos and fish tacos. They were so fresh, not over seasoned to the point of salty, and both were cooked perfectly. Will definitely come back and work my way through the menu."

                "text": "3.5\n\nThere is so much good Mexican food -- from many, if not all, of the states/regions -- in Nashville that if one whines that s/he can't find any, I immediately put them on block. I can't waste time with willful ignorance. And, yes, the standard at many of these eateries is the taco.* Tacos are good and all but sometimes you need a break from them. Enter: the mulita. \n\nI hadn't had much luck finding these bad boys in Nashville until lately. You always remember your first time so to my understanding, mulitas are sort of like corn torilla-based tortas. The way I had them, the tortilla was more arepa-like and between the two was meat, cheese, onion, cilantro, and guacamole. Super good. Very tasty. Extremely addictive. At El Taco Jalisco, the mulitas are made with thin, standard corn tortillas, meat, cheese, cilantro, and onion. At $2 a pop, I am not going to lose my mind about the lack of relative heft. Perhaps mulita preparation varies by region? Perhaps I got a bargain basement mulita? At $2 a mulita, I'm going to call it a wash. ETJ has a wide variety of meat options so dig in and see what you like. I ordered 4: pollo, asada, chorizo, and barbacoa. The barbacoa was far and away the best meat option. I don't know where or how they're making their bbq, but it was fantastic. Don't get me wrong: all of the meat (and, thus, the mulitas) tasted great but the barbacoa was next level. From what I could see, the kitchen is a food truck connected to the dining room. The guys back there put in some serious work.\n\nSomething else I noticed was how clean the dining room is. The room is a good size and it's sparkling white. I think this has something to do with the woman who was running the dining room. She was on the phone taking orders, she was directing traffic, she was quality controlling the plates that came out from the back... she did it all. The reason for the 3.5 (rounded up) is that she was the only person who was at all friendly. There were three other young ladies helping her the evening I came in and none greeted, smiled, spoke, or otherwise made me feel welcome in the establishment. I noticed them interacting with other customers in Spanish so, perhaps, it was a perceived language barrier. I speak decent enough Spanish (especially when it comes to food) and at other Mexican restaurants I am greeted in Spanish, respond in Spanish or English and take it from there. Here, I was iced out. I saw one of the women bring my order out and she just left it at the front. After do\u00f1a ETJ was finished doing all of her jobs, she asked the girl whose food she'd just left on the counter. She motioned to me and the woman in charge gave her a 'then why didn't you give it to him?' look. She, then, called over to me with a smile and gave me my food. So... full story.\n\n*If you're paying more than $1.50 for a taco you're doing it all wrong. You are. Feel ashamed."

It was packed with meat, and had a healthy portion of all the other fixings - beans, rice, guac, sour cream. I asked for the habanero sauce to go with my burrito, which was sweet at first with an incredibly spicy kick. If you're not hungry enough for a giant burrito, the tacos looked awesome as well.

The spices did leave this coating on my tongue like if you were to just dip the tip of your tongue into some allspice \n\n4. Raspberry Mascarpone - The most basic of the 4 doughnuts.

I came around 1:30 pm. There was no line but had to wait as 2 employees were busy filling an order for the woman waiting near the register. After that, this male employee took my order. I decided to get:\n\nStrawberry Lavender, $1.75- This was served warm and had a nice flavor of sugar strawberry. The lavender was subtle.\n\nPeach Ricotta, $2.75- I was curious as to what this would taste like and decided to order this. This donut has a glaze of peach and the middle is filled with ricotta. The peach is a little too sweet. Please note that this donut was not served warm and is considered a fancy donut, thus a higher price. I did not know this since there was no sign on the display case to indicate these are fancy donuts (I don't eat donuts often). \n---------------------------\n(Total= $4.50, tax included)\n\nI was disappointed that the donuts fell apart too easily and made for a mess. They just didn't hold up, compared to other donuts that I have had before. \n\nI was also very disappointed with my visit when I came here. After I made my order, I gave the employee my credit card and he gave me a pager. After waiting 14 minutes with no buzzing or lights on the pager, my husband walked back up to the register to ask the employee where our order was. He apologized and said he completely forgot about us. Please note that after my order, there was only one other person who was waiting for their chicken sandwich. Then the place was empty. The 3 employees behind the counter were just talking to each other. This employee began placing our donuts in a bag and said he would give us extra as an apology for making us wait. I didn't know why it took so long and just assumed they making my donut fresh or something. \n\nI don't get what all the hype is all about with Federal Donuts. Is it because they sell chicken too? \n\nThis place really was just average for me. But with the long wait time (if my husband had not inquired, then who knows how long we would have waited. And we were sitting at a table right in front of the register so the employee must have known we were there waiting...). I would not come back here. \n\nPlease note that this location only takes credit and debit cards are payment."

I got the 4 piece chicken tenders because I'm not a big fan of bones in my chicken.  And with my chicken I had a honey butter biscuit and red Gatorade to help my vains pop out of my arms.  My first bite of chicken was definitely crispy and most certainly crunchy but the chicken itself was kind of tough but because my mouth is so ripped it was not that bad.  I ate the chicken like a savage lion, king of the jungle.  When I grow up I will have a pet lion to guard my house.  But the chicken was far from my favorite part.  The honey butter biscuit was like kissing the hand of DJ Tanner or Fuller (if you are a fuller house fan) from Full House.  It was so delicate, beautiful, and tasty .  The one negative about this establishment is that they had a sign that said no shoe no shirt no service.  Well debatable because I have rock hard abs because I do sit ups and my feet are pretty much super model like.  I have been asked to be a foot model but I humbly declined because I did not want people to be jealous of my feet.  In conclusion my overall experience was good so I give this place 69 hams out of 80 sausages."

The neighborhood may seem rough to those who've never experienced a real rough neighborhood, but I've never seen an incident happen in the 4ish years I've been going there. I will say this is more of a take out place. There are tables, but I've never seen anyone eat there. \n\nOn to the food, while I won't say it's the best Chinese I've ever had, it would be acceptable in any city up north as your local Chinese spot. It's the Americanized Chinese I expect without the sickly sweet Panda Express type sauces."

It comes with either a soda or an egg roll.  I got the egg roll.  The beef was tender, but a little fatty (and I'm a person who loves fat).  I enjoyed the egg roll, but the wrap was a little heavy.  I really enjoyed the sauce the dish was doused in and soaked it all up with my white rice.  \n\nOverall, this place was the epitome of fast Chinese food.

They didn't know much about the restaurants' offerings but had a binder full of menus to look through. That really helped point us in the right direction. We had a couple of fantastic meals at Captain Al's, thanks to them! \n\nThe gift shops are basic cheesy touristy deals, no harm done. They are not as classy as the ones I'm used to on the Santa Cruz pier or Pier 39 in San Francisco, but I bought a few postcards. Never saw the aquarium, had heard about it but we just didn't have time to explore that much. People were friendly.\n\nWish we could have seen the Pier in all its lit up nighttime splendor, but I'm not usually up that late so I rely on pictures -- they really are something. \n\nAs a native of the CA coast, it was really nice to visit a pier that encompassed warm weather. How great to feel the Gulf breezes in a light sundress and sandals instead of being bundled from head to toe in the CA cold! The most use I get out of my sundresses is when I'm in FL!\n\nThe missing star is because it's so dirty. Didn't seem to be any cleanup of bird crap going on, and it was piled everywhere.

You have to love the view of both Straub Park and The Vinoy if you're facing northeast.

Right at the corner of Armat and Greene Street, near Maplewood Mall, it is not only a cafe and a specialty market for packaged and prepared foods, but also a restaurant that serves a small menu of home style Ethiopian and Mediterranean-ish foods.  The portions are large, the prices are very reasonable, and everything we ate was fresh and delicious.  The lentil sambusas and the Ethiopian vegan platter were outstanding.  They do not skimp on the spice and there are so many vegetables in so many iterations on the menu.  They also do weekend specials and American-style breakfasts.  The owner is just lovely.  Salam Cafe and Market has a Facebook page with the menu posted, but I don't they have a website yet.\n\nThe hours are posted as 8am - 8pm Monday through Saturday, but I would recommend calling first."

When I'm nice to them, they're nice right back and always helpful if I have a question about something. (Just HOW large is an XXL Stuft Burrito?)\n\nThe aspect that scores this location one star higher than I'd normally rate a Taco Bell is how much food they cram into every taco, burrito, chalupa, etc. There is absolutely nothing worse than ordering a taco, settling down to gorge, and you discover there's a sprinkling of a meat you didn't order and two shreds of lettuce. The items I order are always packed full and hot, and my order is fulfilled accurately.\n\nIf you've got the craving for food that is definitely not good for you, I've found this location to be a solid choice."

We got the Broccoli Beef with Lo Mein and Orange Chicken with Fried Rice. We also ordered cheese wontons. \nThe 2 dishes were SO good! The Lo Mein was probably my favorite part. Mmmmmmm yum. Generous portions. My husband and I shared both dishes with leftovers at the end. The wontons were just ok. I wouldn't order those again. A couple egg rolls somehow made it into my bag even though I didn't order them. Those were really good too. \nI'm excited to go back and try more things and get some more Lo Mein!

Because they make everything to order it takes a little more time then I thought it would...which is great but I'll order before I get there next time!

Unfortunately, the gentleman answering the phone isn't too fluent in English.  We had decided to use their online ordering in hope of receiving a correct order. I had to call the restaurant as the online system placed an order for 2 sweet and sour chicken dinners, when only one was needed.  We confirmed the order for one of each broccoli and shrimp, egg roll, hot and sour soup, and sweet and sour chicken.  We arrived at the restaurant to pay and pick up the order. I will own that I didn't check the order prior to leaving. Upon arrival at home, we received broccoli and beef instead of the ordered broccoli and shrimp.  Immediately I telephoned the restaurant to advise of the error.  Once again, the gentleman answering the phone says we can comeback to exchange it.  I mentioned we weren't getting back out and they could provide a credit for our next order.  He replied with offering 10% off next order.  I suggested 50% since this isn't the first time.  After he conversed in Chinese with another man in the background, he offered 35%.  I told him we have been regular customers over the year and future repeat business was at stake.  I truly do not believe he understood me.  Needless to say, we will not return to China Wok.  There are other places who care about you as a customer and are ready to earn your money.

The way they assemble them seriously is very portable as well.\n\nSo they had one person checking people out and one crepe maker. He did all the crepes and it was a lot! So seriously it took like half hour. So it's not a fast treat on a Saturday morning, but it's really good! \n\nSo many options as/or even customizable. When you look at the menu, you will be like omg! \n\nNow I was confused I didn't see a coffee pot, but I did see creamer. Coffee would work here really well.\n\nThis is a perfect breakfast, lunch, snack or light dinner. So so good!! It is part of a groupof restaurants in Clearwater beach. \n\nCheck them out!!!

Zero GLOVES WORN BY COOKS, kitchen help came out to get a drink and never the 1st handwashing......WOW!!\n\nI don't know where to start. I live here in New Orleans, my brother and his daughters were in from Arizona. I was wanting to show them an iconic New Orleans Staples, such as Daisy Dukes. I remember when this place was American Pie Diner and it could not have been better. Upon Daisy Dukes taking over, service has declined, the quality of the product is not the same as they are at other locations, and the staff was inherently rude. Never mind the fact there were food particles all over the place and in this growing age of COVID-19, I felt very uncomfortable. Nevermind the fact there is no handwashing going on, people touching their faces that were behind the line and the service desk..... I did not see the first repository of hand sanitizer anywhere in the building nor did I noticed any red buckets for cleaning.\n\nSo, we walk in at 11:33 a.m., according to my Google timeline, and we then proceeded to sit there for about 5 minutes before a middle-aged woman, with a bad case of resting bitc* face, with pinkish hair, and a wrinkled face finally came over to us and dropped off menus. She then proceeded to handle other guests and sit at least two or three tables. Those tables got sat, they got served, and they got menus, they got drinks placed on their table, meanwhile, they entered the building 10 minutes after we did. At the 15 minute mark, she comes over to say \"hey I have your drinks on the bar and I'm going to get them to you shortly.\" Another table comes in and they get from sat,, drinks, and menus. Meanwhile, I'm staring at a menu in a table with four other people and my brother says to me \"is this the best New Orleans can do?\" We persisted to wait while other guests continue to get served and handled before we did despite coming in after us. We never once had an interaction with this woman so it's not as if we're being unreasonable. We were just sitting here for 15 minutes and not one drink was placed on the table. After another 10 min, I finally asked her, \"hey, other tables get served, sat, menus, and drinks. Why exactly is my table being made to suffer?\" She again said \"well your drinks are on the bar and I'm trying to do the best that I can\", to which I responded, \"well if this is the best you can do, it's definitely not good enough.\" \"25 minutes and not even a drink..... she then snapped around and nastily claimed it hadn't been 25 minutes Honey, you lost the point. Take care of your customers and quit having personal conversations and you might be able to get something done\n\nStay away!  this place is horrible since Daisy Dukes has taken over and I could not be more disappointed at a New Orleans pillar of hospitality and foodservice.\n\nYOU WON'T ONLY BE SORRY YOU WILL DIE OF THIRST..... a Bactrian camel could not survive we were so thirsty......\n\nCOVID-19 IS A REAL POTENTIAL HERE WITH THE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS INSIDE......\n\nPARCHED NEW ORLEANIAN!!"

The biscuit was huge and it was moist buttery crispy. It was great. Wish I got a picture before I ate lol. My fianc\u00e9 got a 6 inch fish poboy and a 6 inch shrimp poboy they had the really poboy bread, it was more than 6 inches probably about 8 it was a whole filet of fish on it and the shrimp poboy didn't have many shrimp in my opinion but they were real shrimp and they were the big shrimp you would boil, he didn't care for them he said they were shrimpy and he tasted the grease first than shrimp after and he didn't care for the batter it was fried in. They use romaine lettuce for poboy & the fruit cup comes with strawberries, blueberries, 1/4 banana and melon."

At the end of the first day of the move around 7pm, I stopped at the Kentucky Friend Chicken at 803 Hwy 76.  We ordered a 16 piece meal for $42.79 for 4 adults.  I asked for plates and utensils.  Cashier stated they no plates. The Cashier and Servers were not wearing COVID mask.  When we got home (45 minutes later), there were NO biscuits and only 2 sets of utensils.   I immediately called, and reported the findings to the manager, Crystal.  I asked to be compensated for the partial dinner and that I was not going to drive 45 minutes back to their White House store.   Crystal stated she needed to discuss it with her regional manager, Keri.  She was not empowered to help.  It's sloppy customer service to provide a partial dinner.  And I had higher expectations for KFC.\n\nOn Sunday, I stopped by the White House KFC store at 3:00pm, and spoke with Keri.  She stated she was NOT THERE on Saturday, and she would only offer either 8 biscuits OR 4 pieces of chicken.  I don't know about you, but I did not want 8 biscuits at 3:00pm on a Sunday.  During our conversation, she keep breaking away.  Saying she could not discuss it.  I pulled out my camera to record this bedlam, and she went running away.  I asked for a business card - no way.  I asked her to write down her name, title and her manager - she wrote down Crystal name and her title as \"General Manager\".  I askeed her if the store was a franchise or Pepsi owned store.  After 2 or 3 break-away and returns, she finally relented and stated it was owned by \"Alice Sdheler\".\n\nAlice is this how you train managers?  Is this good KFC service?  I need some help given the partial service, partial dinner, and partial response.  Help.  I'm rating my KFC experience as a 1."

We sat down at one of the many crusty looking tables to enjoy the meal we had before us. By the way our food looked like the stuff they fed the rats in the kitchen.

We stopped for food at: Tampa Bay Brewery (wings), Pizza Place for a cheese slice, a restaurant for 1/2 a Cuban sandwich, a restaurant for black beans and rice, cigar shop for a guava empanada and cafe con leche.  The tour took 3 hours.  We met at Ybor Centre and started on time.  There is about a mile of walking.  You learn about the cigar industry and social life of the locals back in the late 1800's and early 1900's. It was an interesting tour and paired with good food.  I definitely recommend it."

The Cuban sandwich really represents the molding of all the cultures in to one great community (the salami for the Italians, the pork for the Cubans and the ham for the Spanish). With great enthusiasm Raymond walked us around Ybor pointing out the original cigar factory that Ybor built. We also learned about the \"casitas\"; homes that Ybor provided for his 1,000 cigar works at cost! Ybor truly turned a alligator run swamp in to a bustling hot spot in the 1920s! Unfortunately, the great depression and machines crushed the city for 30 yrs! \n\nTampa has really made a comeback with Ybor. New breweries, clubs and restaurants are moving in to the area. Truly a mixing of the new with the old. The tour is a lot of fun and I definitely feel I have a true understanding of the area. If you do decide to go on this tour, you must go on an empty stomach. All the food is super delicious but extremely filling. Keep in mind this may only interest people from out of town or those not familiar with the area. All-in-all I had a great time and will definitely be back to Ybor City."

Unfortunately, they did not share juicy tidbits that these tours often include but I did learn a lot about the area.\nIf you are looking for food: This is not the tour for you. We had wings, pizza, and a sandwich. seriously? I've been on dozens of these tours in cities large (NY) to small (St. Augustine) and they all had amazing gourmet food that you couldn't find on your own. Either this area is just a bar-food kind of  area, or the tour company doesn't have the right connections. If you are a foodie and going to have GOOD food, this isn't the place for you. You will be sorely disappointed.\nOrganization: 1. You walk in the sun for 30 minutes at a time, and then for 2 minutes going across the street. The organizes should be wiser in their chioce of locations so that breaks from the florida sun are more reasonable and better divide the time by choosing better locations. In addition, the guides have NO IDEA what is served where. They are ill prepared to service any special food needs. Yes, i am vegetarian, but like I said - I've taken at least a dozen food tours and have been fully accommodated with amazing food on every single one. Here, the places were not prepared to give anything decent. And at one of the places the tour guide said the food was vegetarian when it had chicken stock. This tour does NOT accommodate special dietary needs and should stop saying it does or should get a clue. BTW - the place was (As a result) ill prepared to offer a substitute and we got a few pieces of lettuce with a tomato on top. I don't need to pay $59 for that."

I would definitely suggest getting the Groupon, as I noticed almost everybody (if not everybody) in our party had one.\n\nThings I enjoyed about the tour.\n\n1. The tour guide was super knowledgeable. Pat was a joy to listen to and she clearly knew her stuff.\n2. The restaurants were interesting and I enjoyed the food for the most part.\n3. I feel like I walked away with a lot more knowledge and appreciation for Ybor City.\n\nThings that could be improved.\n1. I wish I knew ahead of time that we would visit one restaurant and then 45 minutes would elapse before making it to the second. Pat warned us about this structure at the beginning of the tour, but that was too late for me to eat something before we started. I figured this was a food tour at prime lunch time, so I came hungry. That was definitely a mistake.\n2. I thought the pizza was kind of a cop out. That didn't seem like a special dish to me in any way. This is a restaurant that many people have stumbled upon drunk and grabbed a slice for $3. It was odd to visit it on a food tour.\n3. The last stop was a cigar vendor, so there were people smoking inside. A few of us on the tour ended up waiting outside because we didn't want to be inhaling smoke. One of the other tour participants even noted that this was a super odd choice as a final stop. Surely we could find good coffee somewhere else.\n\nI think this food tour is a fun way to experience Ybor City, but it probably wouldn't be top of my list of recommendations if someone wanted to know what to do when visiting Tampa Bay."

The whole tour took about 4 hours and ends right where you start. With samples from 5 different local establishments. I would highly recommend this tour if your thinking about it. Also look on Groupon as they might have a deal or two going on there. And bring your appetite and good walking shoes. Also for you cigar lovers you stop off on a great cigar smokeshop. Essentially every place you stop is more welcoming than the last.  I don't really give out 5 stars much. So no offense on this company, in my opinion they were top notch!"

The floor was dirty on both the customer side of Dairy Queen and behind the counter where the workers are.  Dirt, chocolate, straws, spoons, napkins and other things just laying on the floor. \n\nAlso The staff was not very quick to greet customers coming in and taking orders promptly. I was the only one in line and the young lady behind the counter was messing with a blender, turned around and we made eye contact. Instead of letting me know they would be right with me... she just kept on messing with the blender. Approximately 3-4 minutes later a young man finally came to the counter and asked if I'd been helped. I let him know that i had not, 8:03 pm he quickly jumped on the register and \"tried\" to take my order. It was a simple order, 1 mini chocolate chip cookie dough blizzard, 1 hot fudge sundae with everything( peanuts, whipped cream, and a cherry on top), and 1 mini pecan cluster blizzard. The young man could not figure how to input the order or make sure that the hot fudge sundae had all the toppings. He finally asked the girl for help, the one that ignored me and was working on the blender. The order was finally placed and it was time to wait. So I took a seat at a little counter area that they have close to the counter. I figured maybe 2-4 minutes tops to get my order. Well I was wrong, I guess I assumed that because there 5-7 employees total working to make the orders and get them out quickly. \n\nWhile I waited a young man walked in with his female friend, the wound man quickly greeted him and told him \"I got you\" the young man that walked in was from the new dominos pizza right next door to Dairy Queen, they talked and bartered ice cream for pizza. Very unprofessional in my opinion but who am I to judge. Maybe that's how they do it at both businesses. The girl and the dominos pizza guy order several items and continued to talk about life events in each other's life( both the dq worker and the dominos worker) now its been about 10 minutes since I ordered. Still no ice cream. I walk up to the counter and ask how much longer, he apologizes and checks. Tells me one more minute! 5 minutes later still no ice cream. Dominos pizza kid and girl get all of there ice cream for \"free\" and walk out the door. Finally they walk up with my ice cream, 8:23 pm about 20 minutes after I order. Both blizzards completely melted like if they were ice cream shakes not blizzards, no hot fudge Sunday yet!!!! They were cleaning the outside of the blizzard because of all of the melt off, never flipped the blizzard upside down because it would have splayed in the floor like all the other nasty ness that was already there. I reminded them about the Sunday, they Findlay brought it out with no toppings, had to remind them of that also. I did let them know about my melted blizzards and non of them batted an eye. Never asked if they could remake them, or offer a refund. 8:33 finally left the store with two milk shakes aka melted blizzards and a half assed sundae. \n\nOn my receipt they have a survey you can take online, I went to the online website and it let me know I could not complete the survey because that store does not exist!!!! So I couldn't even tell them what terrible service and product they served that night.\n\nMost of us have been going to Dairy Queen for years this was absolutely the worst experience that I've ever had at a Dairy Queen. I hope they are able to get their stuff together and let their staff know that they need to make sure that they are providing the best service available. They were a lot of team kids that were working behind the counter but I would hope that they would have a better work ethic or possibly learning from this experience.\n\nI wasn't able to get any pictures of the product itself, I was pretty upset and forgot to do that. But as you can imagine it look like a melted blizzard and the Sunday look like something a two-year-old could've made"

I grew up around BBQers who knew their craft, and t's difficult to find that same quality in Florida.  But when I do, I will drive an hour to enjoy that savory smoked meat.  Not Your Mamma's BBQ meets that criteria. Ribs, pork, and brisket are tender, flavorful, and never dried out. It doesn't require a drowning of sauce to get by, but the sauce is just an added component and not the center of flavor. Chef Ken has honed his craft around a smoker, but has the added bonus of being a master baker.   So when you go, save some room for dessert, because if bread pudding is on the menu, you get it.  Not sure if that's a law, or in the Bible or something, but you get it.  Period.  You'll thank me later."

Wish we had this restaurant by us back home. You can bet we will be frequent diners when we are in town. Get to Not Your Momma's BBQ! Amazing!!"

Unfortunately for me they were sold out. So tonight I had the pork sammich, Mac n cheese and coleslaw. Everything was amazing. \n\nThe portions are large enough that you bring home leftovers. Their traditional sauce was spot on. My husband got half a rack of ribs. Fall off the bone and delicious and we have leftovers with them as well. \n\nThe prices are higher then other places however the quality and portion size offsets this. \n\nWe will be back.

The menu has several Poke combination suggestions, but really you can add/subtract anything you'd like along the way in a fast casual Chipotle-esque style.\n\nI tried a build your own bowl with sushi rice, marinated tuna, shrimp, and assorted veggies and three of their signature sauces including the spicy-sweet wasabi aioli.  Ask for any of the sauces on the side, if you want to test them out! If you're looking for low-carb, high protein (like my boyfriend) you can opt for salad greens instead of rice and then pile on the toppings!  For those not interested in raw fish, there's a chicken/spicy chicken option too.\n\nNo matter what the combination, the end result was delicious and fresh, service was prompt and friendly, and I can tell this will be a summer staple for us.

The characters are very entertaining, and it was quite special to visit Independence Hall in the evening, after all the summer weekend tourists had gone for the day. The peace and quiet made it almost possible to smell that Revolutionary air inside the Assembly Room, and the discussion among Messrs. Adams and Jefferson and Dr. Franklin was  quite moving at times. The dinner at City Tavern was OK. As someone mentioned, the various breads and dessert were very good. I was disappointed, however, that we were seated under a tent in the restaurant's garden rather than inside. Thankfully, it was a lovely evening. \n\nThe City Tavern experience is as much about the restaurant's ambiance as it is the food. My husband and I have dined inside the tavern in the past, so we know what it's like. (We quite enjoy it.) If that's the experience you're hoping for, better check ahead to see where, on this tour, dinner at City Tavern will be served."

This is where it all happened.\n\nBear in mind, my review is written based upon our visit to Philadelphia and our having taken this tour package on September 1, 2018.\n\nThe meal at City Tavern was very good. We were seated at tables downstairs, and the room size was perfect for our group. The actors and actresses had ample room to carry on with their dialogue and fun while we ate.\n\nFrom the City Tavern we walked (via our \"tour guide\" John Dunlap) over to Independence Hall. It was just getting dark when we arrived and the place was absolutely beautiful. I am also posting photos, which include some taken outside of Independence Hall, before and after we were taken inside the building for a private tour, and a peek into a vital point in our nation's history... dare I say, the world's history(??).\n\nThe package is well worth the cost, as it is filled with many different treats and available points of history being presented. I would especially recommend this for families, and it is equally applicable to couples, singles, young and old!\n\nGo and support these fine folk who do a magnificent job, putting on an outstanding display of a peek into our history."

Not 15 mins later, I was in the store placing my order. I like firehouse because they serve their sandwiches warmed with melted cheese and they have a great array of toppings to choose from. I went with the GF medium club and it did not disappoint. I added hot peppers, cherry peppers, peperocinis, and pickles to spice it up. The sandwich was about $9, gluten free bread +$2 (a little steep, but whatever), and add a combo with chips and drink +$3.50, all amounted to about $15 for lunch.

Definitely excited to try.\n\nCame in for lunch! The woman at the counter was such a sweetheart, recommending me some things and asking me if it was my first time in. \n\nI went with the chicken kabobs and a pulled pork sandwich to split with my fianc\u00e9. The pork tastes great! I love the BBQ sauce, it's not overly sweet and the pork doesn't taste like pure vinegar which is always a fear of mine. Nice soft bun as well! \n\nThe  kabobs are also very good! Chard on the outside and pulls apart nice and tender on the inside! They are huge in size too! You really get a lot for what you pay for.\n\nSpeaking of prices, they are great! The quality of food is very good, the service was exactly how I like to be treated, and the location is perfect for me.\n\nThank you for lunch! I'm loving every bite!

The sweet and spicy (extra) was quite distinct from other places in that it was quite spicy. The parts I didn't like as much were that the pieces were quite differently sized from one another and a bit difficult to eat, that there were too much breading for my liking compared to other Korean Fried Chicken places, and that the meat was not as flavourful as expected (the sauce made up for it though)"

I was aiming to get the elote fries but they were sold out which was a bummer but it was my fault for showing up late. They prep daily so everything is fresh and they make everything when you order it. So no hotdogs hanging out on a roller or in a steamer here. \n\nThey have a sign stating to expect approximately 15 mins but it was probably half that and there were a couple people ahead of me.

To date, they've been apologetic and happy to offer a redo or free pizza with next order.  Today, I ordered my \"redo\", and upon pick up, I was informed by the owner, Jim, that he would no longer replace any improperly-made, special-order pizzas.

While I'm not a vegan I decided to try it because it smelled amazing! I was not disappointed! I ordered the nachos which included beyond meat (plant based protein). It had a barbecue flavor. It was really good. The ladies that served us were also very knowledgeable about what we should order based on the type of food we like. That said, rather you are a vegan or not, or maybe you are curious about vegan food, this is a place you should start. I give it 4 stars only because i think they are a tad pricey but the food is great!"

I was first in line and practically jumped into the food truck!\n\nI ended up ordering two burgers because I you only live once and who knows when I'll run into the food truck again.\n\nThe first one I sampled was the guacamole burger. The teriyaki sauce that comes on all 3 burgers is amazing!!! Spicy and sweet! Perfect pairing with spinach, pickles, onions, and guac all piled high on the burger. \n\nNext was the bacon ranch burger. Oh. My. Goodness!!!!! It is sent from heaven!!!! The saltiness of the bacon plus the teriyaki sauce is a match made for your taste buds! I would choose this over a real burger any day! \n\nBoth burgers came with a side of guac and chips. The price point is a little higher than a beef burger ($15-$19), but it's good for your body and soul!"

Drenched, we hurried to meet up with the comedy tour bus we had picked as our day's prime activity.  The bus did not show at the appointed hour.  We waited and waited only to eventually learn that the tour bus we were waiting for had collided with a motorcycle parade [true story] and that our tour was cancelled.  Distraught, we wandered around, wondering what we could do with our day.  We ended up taking a short and uninteresting horse drawn carriage ride with a driver who immediately copped an attitude with us as soon as we said we were from California and who, as an added bonus, did manage to convince us that we were about to spend the rest of our vacation with food poisoning due to the hot dog we bought off the street while we were hurrying to meet the tour we didn't get to take.  Disappointed and dejected (and waiting to become powerfully ill) we set out to see the Parthenon.  \n\nIn the vicinity of Parthenon, we stumbled on a gathering of food trucks.  Having lived in LA in the not too distant past, where the food truck scene is prime, we pulled over and went to investigate.  We sampled a couple of food trucks, most of which were forgettable and forgotten, and then we tried the chicken and waffles from The Waffle Boss.  We were instantly tickled by the variety of waffles and the guy taking our order was so friendly.  We became cautiously optimistic.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken and regular waffle while I ordered the chicken and red velvet waffle.  We had to wait 20 minutes or so, but man, it was so worth it.  The chicken (which came in strip form) was perfectly cooked and juicy with a crunchy delicious coating seasoned in such a way as to give a little flavor punch and perfectly offset the flavor of the waffle.  The red velvet waffle was a beautiful crimson color, so enticing to the eye that even if I was not a fan of chicken and waffles I would have been thrilled to eat it. [I confess to snapping a couple of pictures so I could elicit the proper amount of envy when I returned to Cali].   It was fluffy, dense (but not overly so) and flavorful.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Combined, the chicken and red velvet waffle were genius.  Not since Roscoe's in LA had we enjoyed chicken and waffles this much (and that is saying something).   Our day was instantly saved.  For a moment we kind of wished we lived in Nashville. \n\nAmazing work Waffle Boss!  Cook on!"

I will say that the sole reason was SOOOOOoooooooooo much build up and not much delivery. Why was there so much build up? When I ordered, I was told it would be 20-25 minutes. OK.. I can deal with 25 minutes for PERFECTION!  Who couldn't? He told me to check in at the 20 min mark. So.. While we're waiting we go to the Biscuit Love truck. Get the Princess biscuit from them. We eat that. We then walk around a bit and circle back to Waffle Boss at the 20 minute mark. Guy tells me... Another 10 minutes.  So we walk next truck over to the Sum Yum Yum truck and order a Bon Mi. We Eat that too. I check in again at the 35 minute mark. Guy tells me..... Another 10 minutes.So we walk over to the Delta Bound truck. They are sold out of most things so we just get their dessert offering. We ate that. Come back to the Waffle Boss and still wait....  It took 52 minutes to get out my order of Chicken and Waffles (original) and some fried Okra. \n\nHere's the let down. Seasoning. The Okra had none and wasn't cooked quite long enough. The chicken has some, but not enough. I will say that the chicken was cooked properly and not over or under. It had more breading on it than I liked too. I can't imagine anyone likes that much breading on their chicken actually.\n\nSo, for all that build up to get under seasoned Okra and over breaded Chicken, I was quite disappointed."

Waffle Boss adds this delicious cinnamon butter you can apply to your waffle, and it's almost like cake icing -- it absolutely made the dish.  Without it, I probably would have given only 2-stars; but the flavors really brought out the chicken and waffle combo and definitely bumped them up to 3-stars.\n\nThe guys in the truck were friendly, and service took about 12 minutes (I don't know if that is slow or fast relatively speaking).  I thought it was a bit pricey at $9, but such is the business of food trucks when you have a fixed cost that included higher gas prices and storage of your vehicle.\n\nI don't think I would go back again, but I'm glad I tried it and I would recommend it to a friend to go and try as well.  \n\n(Side note: they offer flavors such as red velvet and birthday cake and are in the batter of the waffle in case you were wondering.)"

The wait staff are courteous and professional.  And my food -- from the butternut squash and lemongrass soup to the sea salt and caramel creme brulee -- was fabulous.\n\nSo why did I give Level 33 one star?  Because they handed me a wine list without any item pricing -- that's why.  I ordered a simple bottle of 2011 Ruffino Moscato d'Asti and they charged me sixty dollars for it.  That was the total price for a business dinner for two, inclusive of coffee and desserts, and the unpriced bottle of wine doubled our bill.  You can walk into any liquor store and pick up a bottle of Ruffino Moscato d'Asti for 11.99.  I expected to pay thirty dollars for it.  I was, in a word, bled.  \n\nMy advice to the owners of Level 33 is this:  Provide a wine list with itemized pricing for your customers or they will never return, because they will always, always leave your premises feeling ill-used.  For that reason and that reason alone I will never return to this lovely sky lounge, despite the otherwise excellent faire.  Farewell Level 33..."

I was the only person in the entire store and was greeted by the one Subway employee they had working there.  She was quick to take my order, but once she started to assemble my sandwich the problems began to appear with this gas/way combo.  \n\nShe proceeded to put miniscule amounts of lettuce and veggies on my sandwhich, whereas the bread was completely visible on the inside of the sandwich once it was compiled.  I requested additional items as she was assembling it and even then it was too much effort to put more than two additional bits of lettuce and such into the sandwich.  I was too exasperated at this point to have her remake the sandwich and just paid for it and left.  The only redeeming quality and reason they got even one star is that if you work in the area, they have a list of employers who they offer a free 16oz drink with an id badge.

The bacon wasn't all chewy it was fried right and crispy and the egg and potato didn't have a greasy taste. The red salsa they give you is hot but good.

The first was that the bun got soggy way too quickly. Which didn't make eating it a lot a lot of fun. The second was the fried bacon on the burger. It could've been better and fresher.

This was my first visit, so I really had no idea what to expect. \nThe shrimp were not jumbo, and I did not expect them to be. The scallops were also on the small side, but again I was not expecting them to be.\nI was pleasantly surprised that everything was very fresh and I was definitely happy with my order. I think the amount of food was a generous portion, I was surprised when I opened the package at home. \nThe interior was very clean and at the time I was there it would have been around 12pm, I was happy about that. \nI will most definitely make another trip to try something different on the menu.

I got the chicken steak and shrimp hibachi with a side of broccoli , it literally took me three days to eat it . The homemade yum yum side is too die for . We got a big side sauce so we can enjoy it at home also . My husband got the special fried rice filled with chicken steak and shrimp . He loved it he loves fried rice and he said it was one of the best fried rice with meat and vegetables that he has ever had , they only complaint he had was that he could have ordered more vegetables in his rice like a broccoli or more mushrooms .

That's when he stopped by to see if our order had been taken- so we are ordering our food and one of the things we wanted was the pork belly app...well guess what the couple that had gotten there 15 minutes after us just ordered the last one...so no pork belly for us. \n \nWe had the chili wontons, bulgogi beef and ramen tonkatsu. The wontons and beef were pretty good. The beef would not have been enough for an actual meal, you would need to order two robatayakis. Like other yelpers had reviewed the ramen did not have much flavor at all. I had seen the owner leave reviews that they were still working on the menu so I was hoping it had been improved- and honestly just flavorless. We added a bunch of hot sauce which gave it some heat. I was pretty bummed. \n\nTwo positives: the water had lemon and lime in it which I liked, they also bring out picked vegetables to the table as a free starter. We had the veggies brought to us before we had any place settings. The waiter for the place settings to us quickly after that though which is when we also got the delish water.\n\nI don't think I'll come back here again until I see a lot of positive yelp reviews. Hoping this restaurant improves and can survive here. I love being able to walk to eat!"

We were very impressed with the quality of the food and the service.   Diego, our server, was very professional and was very attentive to our needs for our group.  Most of us ordered the curry Alaska noodle soup which was heaven in a bowl.  The seafood and noodles were just delicious and the fact that they make their own noodles in the restaurant was just the icing on the cake of perfection.   I ordered the crispy pork as an appetizer which was very tasty.  The dessert was delicious and very different.   It was a custard like dessert that was very smooth and great on the palate.  The owner was nice enough to stop by our table and say hello and talk about the background of the restaurant.   It was very personable and felt wonderful that he would take time to talk to us about our dining experience.   I will definitely be back here for lunch or dinner.  This is a great restaurant that everyone should experience."

My boyfriend and I tried the Beef Haw Fun, Shoyu Ramen, and Crispy Pork Belly. Everything was hot, well executed, and packed with flavor. \n\nThe broth of the Ramen was unique. It was very savory probably a beef and miso broth with sesame oil... I loved the flavors. The beef in the Beef Haw Fun was perfectly cooked and super delicious.. although I feel like it could have used more spice (next time I'll ask for sriracha) and the pork belly was some of the best I've ever had. Liked the drink menu as well. It was unique and we found stuff we hadn't tried before! \n\nOur host and server periodically checked on us and made sure we felt welcome and happy with the food. When we asked questions (like hey what's better this or this) they were quick with suggestions and opinions which I love especially when I'm at a new spot. The pork belly alone is worth coming back for!!!"

Unfortunately , when we were heading home, they forgot my wife's drink order. Not a deal breaker though \n\nTheir pork bento box was good.

I just hope the location is not a jinx since the last couple of restaurants didn't last very long. \nHowever the new spot has quite the potential. It's interior is very nicely done, with big bright art on the walls and more seating than you would expect when you look at it from outside. I recommend reservations, as they had to turn away a lot of folks the night that we visited. \nWe had to make do with a limited opening menu, but still had plenty to chose from. Can't wait to see the full menu once they are up and fully running. \nWe started with a little freebie appetizer of 3 differently pickled vegetables. All of which very spot on, my favorite being the tiny little onions. If they ever sell those to go, I will buy them all up.\nI was particularly interested in the Robatayaki grill and so I ordered Nam Prik Shrimp. They were delicious, not sure what they did to these shrimp, but it works. Please be aware that all of the grilled items are very small, you will need something else ot go with it. There were three large shrimp in my order... yes huge shrimp, but 3 won't fill me up. \nSo I am glad to have also ordered the chili wontons. Looks a little like ravioli, but hte taste is really interesting. The filling wasn't too great in my opinion, but my friends praised it a lot. \nThe wok fried veggies were also quite delicious. We all agreed on that. \nThe curry and various ramen were served steaming hot in large bowls filled to the brim  with noodles and broth and various delicasies. I heard zero complaints from my guests and they are a picky bunch. \nI also enjoyed a Vietnamese Iced Coffee, which was served in a huge glass. Strong delicous coffee. Highly recommend. \n\nPersonally I say, check it out. I will certainly be back."

Those were both delicious and small little flavorful pre-dinner pieces to our meal. \n\nWe then got the Beef Haw Fun, the Curry Laksa, and the Ramen Tonkatsu. The Ramen and the Laksa were very similar in styles, but completely different in flavors. The Ramen was very traditional and had all the textures and ingredients that you would expect. It was good.

The best thing was the spicy wontons, and I would definitely order them again. \nThere was a tiny kimchi side that was VERY good, I wish I had more of it.  \n\nWe ordered the pork belly belly which was fine. The pork tonkatsu ramen had pretty good broth, but the noodles were stuck together in a huge lump making it a little harder to eat. I do think this was the fault of getting it to-go so I give that a total pass and would guess that the dish is better fresh in the restaurant. \n\nThe chicken udon has great noodles, but the broth was very bland and the chicken bits in it were tough and chewy. We also ordered some peanut chicken skewers and I have no idea if it was an accident or how they are meant to be served but they were tough and bland didn't seem to have any sauce on them at all, nor with them on the side. Finally, the sticky rice with mango- this is normally one of my favourite desserts, but what we got was weirdly foamy and watery... to be honest it just plain did not taste good and had a weird texture. \n\nI would maybe give this place another try sometime in the future when they are fully open but we normally go to Meet Noodles for ramen and will probably continue to do so."

Speaking for my husband and I, both of our noodles were bland which we ended up adding chili sauce to. The mango sticky rice barely had any mangos in it, a lot of coconut, and unfortunately bland as well.

Even though I'm almost 100 percent sure covid didn't help their business and keeping the money coming in i can absolutely guarantee their business practices had something to do with it.  I absolutely loved the owners wife but the owner(after Jim) was not a very nice person. As much money I gave that business throughout the years they should've rolled out a red carpet for me every time I entered that Establishment. So like I said, I'm sure covid didn't help but YOUR BUSINESS PRACTICES WERE ABHORRENT. I tried to bring in a group of my fellow disabled friends and was treated like absolute garbage, not by the owners wife but BY THE OWNER. So in the end I'll call it covid Karma"

Our meal began with some  warm bread and dipping oil with scrumptious flavor. We enjoyed house  salad as well as a Greek salad. Both were so fresh. We tried the Nabulsi  fried cheese appetizer and were not crazy over that, but the rest of  the food was so amazing, it didn't matter. We ordered the Royal Meal  Lovers Platter and the entire thing was delicious. Our favorites were  the lamb chops, and kufta kabob. We also ordered a child's meal of  chicken fingers and fries and it was greatly enjoyed. \u00a0We can't wait to  try breakfast here. Lastly, I am picky about having freshly brewed iced  tea (not bottled or fountain) and this place makes an absolutely perfect  iced tea. The service is amazing. We can't wait to go back!"

No problem - happy to wait for good food, but there was only one other person in the restaurant. They asked and confirmed my order with me when I arrived in the restaurant but when I left with my food, they forgot one of the items. I was frustrated since we had been driving all day, but it happens so I went back to pick it up. Food was just okay, but pretty pricy for what you get. The exception was the gyro - it was good!\n\nSecond time, we ordered two gyros for pick up. They alerted me that it would take at least 30 minutes to be ready. After hanging up, we decided we were too hungry to wait and called back to cancel the order exactly two minutes after placing it. I apologized and asked to cancel the order, but the woman on the phone fought with me and said it was almost done and it can't be canceled. She said she would have to speak with the manager about canceling it. I don't understand how it could be almost ready if they said it could take over 30 minutes. Eventually she did cancel without charge because she realized I would not budge with her blatant lies. I was really excited to have a Mediterranean place close by, but we will not be trying this place again."

I loved that they pulled the chicken off the kabob for me; as any kabob eater knows-this step has lead to many a disaster.  The chicken was seasoned so well, and so flavorful.  The feta on the salad was light and creamy, and I loved that there was not too much dressing on the salad.\n\nI'm not in this area frequently, but I will definitely return when I am.

I generally try not to write bad reviews especially for mom and pop restaurants as everyone's experience is there own unique one. However all I see are raving reviews on this restaurant and I truly don't understand it. We went here to eat approximately three months ago. We were really looking forward to it as we had driven by the place countless times on our way home And had read great reviews about it. I made a reservation online and we anticipated it all week long which we generally don't do when it comes to restaurants. When we got there there was only one other table in the place. The service was excruciatingly slow. The first thing we noted that it was very warm in there. The atmosphere was not what we had expected or hoped for. There was a loud TV playing a television show for children and I believe the owners children were sitting at a table watching it. Not knocking that but the loud TV did not lend towards the atmosphere we were looking for. We had read great things about the service and how friendly the staff was. There appeared to be two people working, a woman who was serving and a man who was in the kitchen. Neither one of them were friendly or welcoming. Nonetheless we forged forward with our evening. The air conditioning did not appear to be working or it was pushed up but it was probably 80\u00b0 in there so not exactly comfortable. I ordered the lamb kebab and my fianc\u00e9 ordered a chicken dish. To say we were both disappointed with what was brought to the table is the understatement of the year. My lamb kebab was tough and to be honest I can't say for certain that it was even lamb. His chicken was even worse. It was a very small half chicken, absolutely flavorless and burnt beyond recognition. I am hoping that we just got them on an off night and that all of these five star reviews are legitimate. My suspicion would be that there are several like me who did not enjoy their meal at all but do not want to write a bad review about a new family business. Our experience was so bad that we will not be giving this place a second chance."

I'm sorry but I'm not ordering from here again, my favorite place has been the Hungry Greek and I'm sticking to it.\n\nYou would think that something that cost $23-24 dollars that they would put a little care into there food and make it tastes good, but I guess I was expecting to much.  Back to my favorite.\n\nAlso your online menu is way off, it say$17.00 and I paid$23.00 so fix your website."

They definitely don't skimp on the protein. \n\nThe garden sandwich has merguez sausage and if you don't know what that is, it's a spiced beef sausage (SO GOOD) but again lacking on the sauce so it was a bit dry.\n\nThe fries were just okay. Might be better if you sat down and ate there. They got soft on the way home as they steamed in the packaging lol. Needed more cheese and salt too.\n\nWe used their website to order and pickup and it was a smooth process. Will definitely give it a try again."

With all the mediocre chain restaurants in the Wesley Chapel area, this is the first time in years we have been Wowed in a very long time!  The pita with herbed olive oil started was very flavorful.  We ordered falafels for an appetizer that was very flavorful.  The dipping sauce was to die for.  Hubby had the Turkish kabob which was a mix of ground lamb and beef, and selected the Greek Fries as his side. I ordered the chicken kabobs and I have to admit, I can't remember the last time I have had such wonderful chicken.  It literally was so tender it melted in my mouth.  I selected the House Salad for my side that came with a light olive oil, lemon juice, and spices dressing. It was very similar to a Greek salad that we had in Greece a few years ago.  Hubby selected the mint lemonade to go with his meal. It was a frozen non alcoholic drink similar to a margarita. The atmosphere in the restaurant was a step above local chains with white table cloths and fresh flowers on each table. Service was well above par. It was a bit pricier than most of the local chains but, you get what you pay for.  I recommend Garden Mediterranean Grill for any special occasion. You won't be disappointed."

It has variety of kabab. I like all of them. The kabab includes Shish and chicken kabab, gyros, chicken shawarma, kufta kabab and veggies kabab. The meat was well marinated. I like the chicken kabab juicy. The gyros did not have deep meat smell. The kufta has good edge grilled. The meat lovers is recommended if you have two or three. Good to have variety of meat. \n\nService is a bit lack off. This may be the area to be improved. It is about 4.5 stars. The store has too less on service people. It need some help."

If you can't decide between a burger or a pizza then this is the perfect combination. This location has a great atmosphere for after work drinks or meeting up with friends before an oilers game. There is underground parking nearby so you don't even have to walk outside to get there if it's cold. The staff was very friendly and always kept our drinks full. I would definitely be happy to come back here!"

This is a stark contrast to the other BPs in the city. The decor is different, the vibe is different, and expectations are different. I had high expectations for this place but it didn't disappoint. If you all know me, you know that I love BPs - it's my absolute favourite place in the world to go. I've been holding off on coming here because you need to look good! This is the Fancy BPs, after all. \n\nThe venue is very modern and not the typical BPs decor. It's more trendy and being near the Edmonton Tower/Ice District/JW Marriott likely influences this. They can't just have a regular BPs in this area lol. I did really like it though. It's still welcoming and the change in decor hasn't taken away from anything. \n\nThe service was awesome. We had a great server who was quick, nice, and thoughtful. She never let our water drinks be empty the entire night which was great. \n\nBig THANK YOU to Bailee and Jenna for their amazing hospitality as well. :)\n\nFood is of course amazing. I'm excited to go to BPs for my birthday on Tuesday! It will be awesome! Pasta Tuesday BABY!"

The four of us at our table really enjoyed the various pizza options and wings set out in a buffet style for our group. My friends had a few more options to try being earlier to arrive and enjoyed that too. None of us caught if any of the pizzas were a new style but we were super appreciative that our vegan friend was well taken care of too. \n\nService was great and I greatly appreciated the future parking & building tips from the bartender (if you're willing to pay $20, you can park underneath the Edmonton tower but there is no voucher or discount if you go to BPs). As my yelp friend parked in Delta parkade (which was where I was advised to park when I called ahead expressing my mobility concerns) and nearly froze trying to get to BPs from walking outside, we decided to try the pedway back to the car. So instead of going down the escalator, we went towards Delta through what I think is Stantech (there's also parking in that building and it seems to link up to where the Oliers fans were walking back from the game). This route was the friendliest warm walking option to getting parking in a less expensive but colder location, yet still being mobility friendly.\n\nThe place itself has a glam kind of style compared to what is the normal BPs we all know and expect. The space is quite open on the second level. I'm sure as people become aware of this location, it will be a neat drinking & socializing spot for all seasons. Most of the group was sitting at a large table (so they're still great at accommodating large groups) but there was a few smaller groups, like us, that sat in the booths along the windows. Booths with awesome space to set all our winter gear - yay! Finally a restaurant location that plans for our 6 months of winter weather. Maybe the name ice district inspired that but it's brilliant either way.\n\nFor those of you getting dropped off by friends, taxi or uber, the ramp to get to BPs is closer to the Edmonton tower doors corner. The corner BPs is on is all steps. The Edmonton tower doors are also the main doors to access BPs when it's really cold outside. If you're mobility limited like me, chat with a server on the lower main level to see if they'll accommodate opening the staff door for you to access the second BPs level. As then you can take the escalator up (and the bartender mentioned an elevator nearby too). Otherwise you'll sadly be stuck on the main floor, as the only public access to the second level is by a HUGE flight of stairs inside BPs. \n\nOverall, a very lovely space. Now that I know where to park and enter, I can see myself returning in the future. Thanks again!"

Unfortunately that was all is was good for, our pop arrived and was super flat. After letting the waitress know she did tell us that there was an issue with the carbon and she didn't know if it was fixed (but still served us flat pop), she then brought us 'new' pop that still tasted the same. My and my friend each ordered pasta from the pasta Tuesday menu (fettuccine Alfredo and jambalaya fettuccine). I don't think I've ever tasted such watery cheese Alfredo sauce (stuff in a jar around have been better) also came with spaghetti noodle not fettuccine. The jambalaya fettuccine was ok, not very hot at all. We sat there for about 25 minutes without anyone asking us how the food was, once we told the waitress she didn't seem to care at all. Will never go back for lunch again. Maybe drinks at the bar but that's about it."

It is right across Rogers place which makes it so convenient if people are seen a concert, a game or any type of performance. The area does have several places to park. I decided to park at City Centre as after 5 PM is oly $5.00 which I think it is the cheapest around that area. I ordered a vegan pizza which was totally delicious with a big slice of tomatoes! I was feeling very cold so decided to get a perpermint tea. I totally recommend BP's to other people as it does accommodate large groups, close to Downtown and the Ice District!

This is one of the newest BP locations in Edmonton, and it is conveniently placed in one of the most popular new areas of the city - The Ice District! The menu is standard Boston Pizza fare, but the service at this location is really outstanding. Also, the venue itself is impressive. This location has two floors with the entire upper level being the lounge area. There are many TVs to watch the game on while enjoying some food and a few drinks. You could come here to watch a hockey game and still feel like you're right in the action (it's just across the street from Roger's Place), but you could also come here for a bite before or after an event at Roger's Place."

It seems a little odd to have a Mexican restaurant open up directly across from Fitos, especially with such high prices, but it looks like seafood is their specialty, so hopefully there's enough of a niche that both places can survive.\n\nThe big sign out front says \"take-out and delivery only\" but the place is packed on a Friday at noon. Literally packed. There is no social distancing, and this place is small. They also don't currently offer online ordering, so I'm not sure if delivery is even a thing. Hopefully it will be, because that would be convenient.\n\nI entered, surrounded by people, and was given a full menu. I had to ask for a lunch special menu. They have very limited choices for lunch for 8.99. I decided to order from the main menu. Chile relleno + cheese enchilada + rice/beans for 11.99. I was told it would be a 20 min wait, so I sat outside. If you have Covid concerns, you definitely want to sit outside.  This place is a Covid nightmare. There is no signage requiring masks, and one small bottle of sanitizer at the front, presumably for employee use. While i was there no one used it. Bare hands wrapped silverware.\n\nThey have a small bar (six seats) and 10 tables, most seating four. Definitely not a place for groups. \n\nBesides Covid issues, the biggest problem I see is organization. They seem to have no system. After 15 min outside, many people cleared out, so I went in and sat at the bar. 2 closed containers of food were sitting at the food window, and no one looked at it. I realized that I hadn't paid, and they hadn't taken my name. I asked the bartender if I could pay. There was confusion and it took asking several servers before they find the one who took my order. She came over and I paid. She said it would be \"ready soon\", then went over to the window. Lo and behold! The remaining food that had been sitting for at least five minutes getting cold was mine! \n\nThey do include chips and salsa with take out, so that's nice. The salsa is pretty good, freshly made. The beans had a canned taste, but good consistency. There was a weird sour flavor to them. The rice was fluffy, pretty average. The cheese enchilada wasn't too greasy, and was generous with the cheese filling. The sauce was mediocre. It tasted very Americanized. The relleno was really good. The batter was fluffy, lots of cheese filling. Really no complaints. Overall, it was definitely less greasy than most Mexican places, so that was nice. The food is about average. But the service needs some desperate help."

So needless to say we were thrilled when they were opening one in Vail. We also know that anytime they open things in vail it's super crowded so we waited a bit and decided to go sort of late on a Friday night around 8pm. \nI walk in and there seemed to be mass confusion. One lady was complaining about something having to do with her to go order. I stood there looking and waiting to be greeted along with another person for about 10 minutes. The girls working there seemed to be trying to figure something out while me and the other lady were invisible. They finally figured out what was wrong and we were seated and they took the other customers to go order. From there things got better. Same great food as the other locations, hence the 3 stars. But the service continued to struggle. We had to wave out server down each time we needed something. She never would have came back to our table had we not called her over several times.

The manager or owner came up immediately and showed us the dinner specials that started at 5pm. He was very friendly.  We liked that.  We had gotten there about 445pm but he was willing to let us order early if we wanted dinner menu. \nHe was out of several of the beers we chose.  Not complaining because I know the restaurant is new so I will give them a break on this. \nThe menu is huge, lots of seafood items and a good selection of combinations.\nThey serve their chips with 3 salsas.  The spicer and medium were both good. The 3rd one looked like enchilada sauce.  I didn't care for it and it was made with flour or cornstarch which I thought was strange for salsa?  It had no real flavor.\nWe order chicken taco dinner and shredded beef taco dinner. \nThe cook made a mistake and gave me a combo dinner with beef enchilada with sour cream along with the shredded beef taco. \nI like the beef taco with tasty shredded beef  but the beans and rice I thought were extremely bland. I couldn't taste any real spice in either of them, just a tomato based broth on the rice. I didn't like the beef enchilada at all. It was made with hamburger, was bland and the enchilada sauce was pasty with no flavor. \nMy husband had chicken taco dinner which he said the whole plate was luke warm. (mine was the same) He also liked the chicken taco but didn't care for rice or beans either. \nThe waitress was good, the food was delivered quickly, but unless they improve the blandness of their food, we won't be back. \nMexican food is my favorite. I love cumin and chile spices, garlic and onion which is used extensively in mexican food.   I cook mexican food all the time at my home so I'm probably a picky reviewer for mexican food.  We love Rancho Rustico on Houghton and have never had a bad dinner there.  My husband likes Coronado's also on Houghton Road.  So, Taco Giro, we love you are in Vail and we want to support you but you need to compete with the other 2 mexican restaurants if you want to remain open for long.  I will try it again and see if anything changes but after the 2nd time, if still the same then we will return back to our favorites in the Rita Ranch/Vail area."

We ordered Mixed Fajitas and a Wet Burrito.  I will tell you the portions were huge, so you absolutely get what you pay for with leftovers.  The food was okay.  I had ordered the ground beef for the wet burrito and it was not seasoned and tasted like it was cooked in a dirty pan, as it was very grisly.

We have been Rancho Rustico regulars since they opened at their original location and the quality of food and service exceeds in comparison.  We might try this place one more time... I am always hopeful a local business will do what it takes to work the kinks out."

This restaurant is poorly managed and the servers are not good. They have no training or don't care about service or both. If you decide to go, set your bar low for service and you'll be fine. If you go right when they open, don't expect food to be fast. This place needs a managers attention fast and train your servers on the drink menu if you're going to offer a drink menu.

Asked politely to switch is out and she gave out a sigh and said \" well I can switch it out but it's gonna be the same. These were made this morning so I don't know what to tell you.\" I asked if she could switch it anyway. She brings me back new chips and says \" it's the same like I said so I don't know what to tell you\". Guess what... the new chips weren't stale. When I was ordering she interrupted me in the middle of talking very rudely and looks at my son to take his order  I'm guessing she doesn't care about her job or tip. She also happens to be the SAME SERVER I got the two other times that were horrible. The food is a hit of miss. It could be good if it wasn't old. Even the horchata has been given to us with the bottom of the drink so it was all chalk and watered down to taste like sweet water. Also, I'm assuming the server knows she's horrible and provides bad service which is why she doesn't wear a name tag."

My experience at the one in Vail was not very pleasant. I was seated and given a menu, chips and salsa and my drink came quickly. That was the only good part. I sat and waited and waited to order; the waitress asked people that came in after me if they were ready to order; however, that table requested more time to read the menu. I got the waitresses attention, as my table was close and stated, \" I am ready to order\" and she replied \"okay\" and walked off and never came back. She later returned and asked that other table if they were now ready to order and they did. After she took their order, she walked past my table and I again stated, \"Excuse me, could you please tell my server that I am ready to order?\". She replied \"Oh, you didn't order yet?\" and then she walked off.  After waiting and waiting again, as though I was either invisible or being ignored, the same waitress that I told twice that I was ready to order, finally returned and took my order (There were only 3 occupied tables, so being too busy would not be a good excuse). After ordering, she stated, \"Oh, by the way; sorry about that.\" I ordered 3 Carne Asada Tacos with guacamole and they were okay. She was nice after I finally ordered and she refilled my drink without me having to ask. The Carne Asada were thin strips that were not very seasoned or tender. The rice and beans were fine. I will probably try this restaurant again (order something different) in about 6 months after they have been open for a while to see if the service and food is better than my first visit.

So. Much. Fun.! There were 18 courses throwing a wide net over all the Santa Barbara seaside, farm lands and occasional winery (Thank goodness Brian who handles the parings focuses most of the wines in Germany, France and Italy--fantastic array--and generous servings.)

If you would like the non-alcoholic pairing, contact the host and they will discount $100 for the selection.  The non-alcoholic pairing in my opinion, is much more labor intensive for the staff, some of the ingredients are fermented days before.  The pours for the wine pairing are pretty light, but add up, as there is a pour for almost every course.\n\nCanapes and champagne are presented in the lobby of the Montecito Inn, while waiting for all the guests to arrive.  There were 6 guests total in our group, the max is 8 and I thought it was pretty snug while dining.\n\nI won't go into all the details of the menu but wanted to highlight the extravagant ingredients that repeat in many of the courses:\n*A5 Wagyu\n*caviar\n*spot prawn\n*king crab\n*venison\n*pigeon\n*gold and silver\n*truffles -black/white\n*Santa Barbara uni\n*matsutakes\n\nFood allergies are taken really seriously here and the staff ensure that the diner gets a comparable meal.

Love how all diners receive a menu and treats at the end of the meal.\n\nThe staff are super friendly, knowledgeable and the dry humor of Danielle really took it to another level.\n\nLocal ingredients are highlighted, along with head to tail animal wizardry.  The price point is what you would expect from this level of dining, I personally think compared to similar meals, it's a bargain and a standout meal/experience from all the others in it's class.

The only tiny thing I noticed was that the wagyu did not cut as smoothly as previous wagyu I've had which was interesting to me. I was surprised that it didn't quite melt in your mouth. The dish was still amazing and I can't say anything bad about anything else I tried. I can go into detail about every dish but it's easier if you just try the food and then you'll know.\n\nAll the alcoholic pairings were amazing! And I kind of wanted to try the non alcoholic pairings more as they sounded very enticing.\n\nThe pricing seems excessive but it includes EVERYTHING! Parking, gratuity, drink pairings, taxes. You don't worry about anything except having a good time. They're not shy about the pours either and there's no limit to them. Once you take this into account, the price is very reasonable. It also may seem like small bites but I was very satisfied at the end. I don't say full because that typically means I overate. Let's just say I wasn't hungry at the end.\n\nQuality ingredients, amazing pairings, and 3 friendly and very talented chefs made for an amazing experience.

                "text": "Calling all sushi lovers, poke bowl lovers, raw salmon and tuna lovers, appetizer lovers, food truck lovers, and sushi taco lovers...\n\nWait, Sushi Tacos?\u00a0 Yes, I asked myself that question too, when my friends Liliana and Herson, my favorite server and sushi chef at my favorite sushi restaurant, Hinoki Sushi, told me that they were working to open up their very own food truck with sushi tacos as one of their main focuses.\u00a0 Sushi tacos are definitely a must, especially if you're a foodie and a sushi lover.\u00a0 It's the most exciting\u00a0 concoction I've seen in a while and it's definitely Delicious with a capital D.\n\nIn the case of Urban Crudos, Sushi tacos are like sushi rolls in taco form.\u00a0 There are elements from Mexican culture- salsas, heat, and citrus- but no meat or flour and corn tortillas in sight (I do see tortillas on their pamphlet as an option, but need to double-check with them).\u00a0 Their fillings are divided into two categories: raw and cooked and all come nicely packed in a deep-fried, lightly battered, crunchy, umami nori sheet with rice.\u00a0 Comparable to hand rolls, but with a crunchy exterior and much more filling, the sushi taco can be customized to anyone's liking using a combination of their awesome sauces.\n\nI was already excited to learn that my friends were applying their full potential (they are outstanding with what they do and have made Hinoki a family tradition for us) in creating their own business, and learning that they were concocting unique fusion foods made me even more excited.\u00a0 I was as excited to hear about their sushi tacos as much as the first time I heard about kimchi tacos in L.A.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my foodie adventure exploring this new exciting food and can't wait to come back for seconds. Update: I went the following day and found gold in the form of poke bowls, one of the best in town.\u00a0 Everything was incredibly fresh and the combination of ingredients were well put together, with lots of room for customization on my part with their many sauce creations, though I didn't use any sauce at all except lime juice and enjoyed it one-hundred percent.\n\nIf you haven't already been to Hinoki Sushi, they are well known for serving up some of the freshest sushi creations using high-quality ingredients and fresh elements, including fruits and veggies.\u00a0 They're also known for their fresh sauces and fast-and-friendly service.\u00a0 Liliana and Herson were big players in building up their reputation, creating the perfect sushi dining experience.\u00a0 You can easily find the same type of service at Urban Crudos: fast, friendly, and efficient and great quality food.\n\nIf you're looking for something new, exciting, and delicious, and served with a smile (yes, you can even see their smiles even with their masks on), please check out this food truck.\u00a0 It will leave you wanting more.\n\nNotes:\n-They are currently parked in the lot of\u00a0Buggy Bath Car Wash\u00a0and plan to be at this location for about a month\n-you can call and order ahead of time.\n-Combo Special: 2 Tacos and one appetizer for $26\n-There is plenty of parking in the lot of Peppermill Casino.\u00a0 Turn into the lot closest to Buggy Bath Car Wash (next to blue-tinted mirrored building)\n-Right now, they only have raw options for tacos and bowls.\u00a0 Next week, they plan on serving their cooked sushi tacos. Keep up-to-date with them on Facebook on Instagram or give them a call\n-their appetizers were all delicious and beyond fresh.\u00a0 The jalapeno popper is nicely fried with a thin layer of batter and is a must.\u00a0 I loved the California rolls that were sprinkled with japanese furikake seasonings.\u00a0 Calamari was fried to perfection and\u00a0 not oily. I loved dipping them in house sauce mixed with teriyaki.\u00a0 The cucumber, edamame, and gyoza were all delicious.\n-one taco is huge and is slightly bigger than the size of two hand rolls.\u00a0 They are packed with so much filling.\u00a0 Since the fish was pure and not seasoned, I added soy sauce and wasabi to all of my tacos for that salty factor, in addition to given sauces.\u00a0 The outer shell was nice and crisp and fried to perfection.\u00a0 Eating tacos within the hour is ideal to experience them when they are the most crisp\n-the trick to a finding the perfect taco for you is to experiment with their sauces.  I advise for new customers to order all their sauces and combine them in different ways to find the right balance, like when customizing poke bowls and sushi burritos.\u00a0\n-their house sauce was spicy but tolerable.\u00a0 Their chimichurri sauce had pepper seeds and was mega spicy.\u00a0 Their tomatillo sauce was not spicy at all.\u00a0 Their teriyaki was perfect and matched with everything\n-they might be at food truck friday\n-they cater parties and events.\u00a0This is exciting and would be ideal for any occasion, especially big ones like weddings\n-no seating, Virginia Lake walking distance"

Sides were fries that were piping hot and crisp and beans (not your usual KC style or even Texas ranchero style) which were different from what I've had in the past but were equally enjoyable to go along with my brisket sandwich. Sandwich could easily stand alone without sauce but the KC style sauce was just too good to resist. Owner along with his pit master, Scott, were both there tonight and couldn't have been nicer (as was the cashier taking our orders). Definitely have found my go to spot in St. Louis for BBQ after many trials at other BBQ establishments around town following our recent relocation. Bravo and keep up the good Q coming!"

We had them cater our wedding at The Bluffs on Broadway this past Saturday, October 9th and everything was incredible! Pulled pork, chicken, brisket, mac-n-cheese, zucchini squash veggie dish and salad were our choices. All through the day, our guests told us that it was the best food they'd ever had at a reception!!  Kudos to  the the owner, Ally Nisbet and his staff for all of their hard work and enthusiasm- we had the best wedding ever! Thank you so much for helping make our day even more special.

They did not have wedge salad or sweet potato chips as their online menu mentioned so a little disappointed that wasn't more clearly indicated before we arrived. \n\nI would still recommend this place as a quick \"take out\" option."

It wasn't what any of us were expecting, being located inside a Schnucks grocery store. Okay, so it's not quite the ambiance we were looking for, but sure, why not have a meal in the small food court style setting? I am so glad we did. Everything, and I mean everything we had was really delicious.\n\nI should start with the customer service. Even though it's an order at the counter situation, the gentleman helping us did a great job welcoming us and walking us through a suggested order. He actually told me if I ordered the cheeseburger, it would probably be the best cheeseburger I've ever had. Pretty bold statement. Especially because, I thought I should order BBQ like my dining companions did. \n\nThat cheeseburger was so good, I didn't even stop to take a picture. I'm glad I didn't, because I probably would have ate my phone while looking at the picture later. It was just expertly seasoned and cooked with perfect simple ingredients and presentation. To be fair, not the greatest I've ever had, but easily in the top 10.\n\nWe had several sides, all of which were dynamite: BBQ beans, Mac & cheese and Brussels sprouts- and the cook even brought us some burnt ends to check out. Everything was excellent. My cohorts loved their brisket and pulled pork too. \n\nThis spot is a real winner. I guess it's a much more streamlined menu then what is offered at their other location. I will definitely be checking out the full restaurant location the next time I am in town. An easy 5 stars."

Half of my wings were done perfectly and the other half was edible but felt undercooked (they were safe to eat, it was the physical texture).\n-Eating the wings was like two totally different flavors, the sauce would barely stick to the wings and you would taste plain chicken and then sauce instead of a combination of the two.\n-The blue cheese dipping sauce I got was, without exaggeration, literally water. If I dipped a celery stick into the blue cheese and pulled it out, it ran right off it as if I never dipped it at all.\n\nI would not recommend Wingstop and I will not be ordering from here again.\n\n(I would however recommend other local places for wings, these would be Baileys, Pizza Hut, WingsToGo, and Pizza Star.

I just had to. Who wouldn't? As soon as I popped it into my mouth, I was flashed back to the days of my youth (or, more precisely, my lunch from yesterday). It tasted exactly like a big mac. It had everything... Burger crumbles, cheese, thousand island dressing, lettuce, pickles (!), and onions. \nAs I walked out, munching contentedly on a swirl ice cream cone, I realized that this single pizza changed this review from a 3 star, possibly 2 star review to a full 4 stars.

Really confident for those not in the area or who might not be able to afford delivery fees.\n\nWe got our meal last night using UberEats. The price is average, but with an app deal it came out to only $6 (a steal!)\n\nMy only disappointments came with the burgers themselves. The taste was great in the patty - really flavorful and filling. However, I paid extra for ketchup and lettuce on the Chris Style and barely got any (see photos). It was also suppose to have fries on top if you check the menu on the website. I think my actual burger had two. \n\nNonetheless, it was still a good burger, even without receiving my desired add-ons. The Beast Style fries were a mess and okay at best compared to other places. A mixture of mayo, cheese, some spice, pickles, and an array of other ingredients. We added bacon but the recipe is more for a stomach ache then a delicious treat.\n\nOverall not bad, considering it comes from a ghost kitchen. I do recommend the burgers, but if you go in person make sure you get what you paid for."

I didn't expect much from the spot, since it's not in an upper class neighborhood. But when I finally took my adult son there, once I got my COVID vaccine, I was pleasantly surprised! First off, the decor is perfect for social distancing. High walled booths and plenty of space, so even with other people dining, we were well isolated! Then the food! He got soft shell crab, my favorite but not usually that good around Delco. He gave me a claw, and it was meaty and tender, just delicious! I had the fried catfish, because I can't get it here. It was thick and flaky, but maybe a bit mild. I like the wild caught catfish with the fishy taste! But honestly, this was great! And the hushpuppies are perfection!! I haven't had great hushpuppies since I was down south last! (and that was awhile ago) But even these were competition to those! I thought the servings were small, but ended up taking some home, so guess not! I will definitely be back. Lots more there to try! Thank you, Woodlyn, for bringing me my dream! Seafood in Ridley!

We were told King crab legs were 49.99/lb which seemed outrageous. We ordered with sauce on the side and I'm glad we did. Mussels were dry. The crab crackers to break the legs weren't even great so it was a waste of food. Shrimp was good when dipped in the sauce, but I was more into the shrimp heads. Calamari was subpar. You would think they made their own for a seafood house. Would I come back? Nope. If the sauce was in the seafood, we definitely wouldn't have noticed.

I've already finished the 1st and the 2nd\" I was confused by this but I decided to let him finish up. He then gave me a bag containing 3 sandwiches with a receipt sloppily thrown in the bag.

I don't get it. Same thing goes for garlic bread with cheese that I ordered and even asked him to make SURE there was cheese on it and of course, no cheese.

Instead of knots, they twist the dough.  While I saw the garlic and butter they seemed a little bland. \n\nWings (HOT) - Terrible. The wings tasted like they were from the frozen food section.  Pizzerias usually do good wings with the exception of the chain pizza shops.  These were just BAD. \n\nPepperoni Pie - Decent pie. The sauce was a little too sweet and there was something about the crust that just didn't jive with my tastebuds. A fair pizza but nothing special. \n\nMini Cannoli - WOW! Star of the show as far as I'm concerned.  I wish these were bigger. They were free with the order, I don't know if they have normal ones on the menu but I'd be sure to get one. They were great. \n\nGood try for a tiny pizza place in shady hills, even with limited selections in the area I don't feel like they stack up with others."

A husband and wife own the place and you can feel their authenticity in the food and in the way they speak to you as if you're family. It felt like we were at someone's backyard cookout. There's an outdoor covered seating space right next to where you order with a little room off to the side where you could choose to eat inside as well, but the outdoor patio was very relaxing so we sat there with our two dogs. The wife brought out a large tray full of filtered water for the dogs on her own without being asked which was super thoughtful. Now let's get to the food! Wow!!! The empanadas were hot, crispy, and exploding with flavor and packed inside unlike a lot of places that serve empanadas half filled with air. Everyone was blown away by the flavors of their entrees- the pechuga was seasoned to perfection and the fried fish my friend ordered was fresh and crispy and done perfectly. Even the sides were made perfectly. The red beans were the best I've ever had. The star of the meal was the salchipapas. I'll be dreaming of them until I come back. The combination of the freshly grilled seasoned meats, fries, cheese, and sauce was out of this world. I cannot wait to come back to this place because it really is THAT good."

While I do miss the prior iteration of this location, Tin Can bar is the next best thing. The same bartender who used to mix my schuylkill punches is now mixing my blood orange margaritas and they are equally kick ass. He is an amazing bartender and I'll follow him anywhere, but for my convenience I hope he stays there. \nThe food was so good too! I wish the menu had a little more but what we tried was wonderful. We shared the Nashville wings which are the same as they were with Bait and Switch, delicious as ever. Some of my favorite wings around. My boyfriend got a burger which he really liked. I got the bbq pork platter which was a revelation. The fries are absolutely fantastic. I'd like to say I got collard greens as my other side but alas I got the macaroni and cheese but I regret nothing.  \nWe are also loving the vibe here. The decor is a little darker which we dig. The pin ball machines, though not functioning during my visit, would be pretty cool, and the outdoor area promises to be lots of fun in warmer weather. \nI can't express my unbridled joy at this place doing its predecessor justice. I encourage my fellow hoodrats to make this place a fixture on their neighborhood rotation, and anyone else to come give it a try."

I ordered the wings with beef fried rice, as did JL Jupiter. For a small convenience fee they cut my wings up, as I like  (OCD) When you're subject to eat in a car. The fried rice was ABSOLUTELY delish,  I asked for duck sauce and hot mustard to which I ended up NOT needing.  The rice was moist and robust with flavor.  My wings (4 piece) were fried to PERFECTION. On my next visit to Philly I'll definitely make it my business, to grace this place with a revisit. I would be trying some of the other Faire.

The Father and owner according to YouTube tells me that they took their last order and that I can take a menu and return when they open tomorrow.  I explain I came quite a ways. He says he understands but kitchen is closed. I stew a few minutes outside, gather my things, get a block away but return. My intent is to clear the air and not have me bad mouthing them over a misinterpretation. The son points to dad who is taking out garbage,, but when I shrug he comes over. I explain to him my grievance.  Young man says they always have to stop orders in order to get out. I ask does it say that online? The  father back from the garbage run a few seconds interrupts the son's answer to ask Didn't I speak to you earlier? And what did I tell you? I(keep that same energy when talking with your Muslim Elders). I  say I was hoping to know when Ownet is in because I call myself supporting Nation of Islam owned,  but feel you aren't supporting me.

If something this trivial got you to come out of Chara, I'm glad I saw your colors early. Most high for self, but what are you doing for others?

Everything comes with potatoes and corn on the cob so no need to order extra and not to mention the awesome sauces you can get on the side!! Highly recommend getting the 'Du Jour' sauce, blew my socks right off! For the first time in a long time I felt like what I ordered from a restaurant was perfectly seasoned.

Pros and cons both times.\n\nDinner order - Hush puppies, make your own catch with snow crab legs, shrimp w/o head, and clams. The hush puppies were flavorfull but were nothing special, I would not order again. The snow crab leg meat easily slid out of their shell and tasted delicious. The shrimp had a watered down flavor typical of shrimp cooked w/o the head. This was an error on my part I didn't want to do the work but I paid for it with less flavor. Clams were delicious. I enjoyed the balanced original cajun sauce more than other cajun seafood joints. \n\nLunch order - Shrimp po boy with sweet potato fries and clam chowder. I have to question if a po boy, with thousand island dressing, is really a po boy. However, the overall flavors of the fried shrimp, fresh romaine lettuce and tomato, and a nice piece of bread were great. The sweet potato was cut a nice size and tasted fresh cut. The clam chowder was tasty but for a $7 cup, I don't want to see it being microwaved.\n\nOverall I would go again but I hope they keep the quality post soft opening."

I don't care if you're closing in 9 minutes. You're not closed and you should have taken the order. I was staying in the quality inn, and I even talked to the blond female delivery driver cause I noticed about her person staying here order some pizza(and it smelled delicious). But I guess I'll eat gas station Pringles now. I would have had exact change cash plus a generous tip for the driver, but too bad. As the manager of a family owned business I know how much it sucks to get a bad yelp review, especially cause yelp agents don't care about businesses, so I'm sorry, but I was hungry, your food smelled good, and I have certain expectations for great customer service."

The Wedge salad was also incredibly generous in size, and absolutely delicious as well.\nI tried their Spicy T roll, minus the Sriracha and with added avocado on top. (Super appreciate they let me do that!) They did not skimp on the tuna--AT ALL! The tuna tasted super fresh (not fishy/tough), and the whole roll itself was delicious. \nThe interior is very well designed, and the staff were all friendly.

While I've been to HotBox before, I'd never been to this Fishers location and decided to check it out. \n\nThis Hotbox is located in a strip center. It's a bit of an older center but there are accessibility parking spots in 2-3 different places along with curb cuts. I parked down in front of Main Event, a bar and grill, and wheeled over to HotBox. \n\nThis location has a decor that is fairly consistent with other HotBox spots I've been in. They do offer dine-in, though that seems to not be the majority of their business as I saw mostly carry-out going on. \n\nI ordered at the counter. I appreciated that an employee moved their menu down a bit so that I could see it in my wheelchair. \n\nHotBox Pizza is, of course, a pizza joint. During the day, they have some lunch and slice options, though this seems to go away at night. That makes it a bit rough for a single person like myself who didn't really want a whole pizza. However, I saw that they had a \"create your own\" option and I ordered a small pepperoni pizza. I also ordered a fountain drink, though I was disappointed they didn't have iced tea. They did have lemonade. \n\nI got my lemonade - I've always liked that their cups are easily reusable. The fountain dispenser was a little high but workable. \n\nMy guess is the pizza took about 15 minutes. I wasn't paying attention and they did bring it to me. So, kudos for that. \n\nI can definitely say this was the best HotBox pizza I've had. The crust was slightly crispy, the pepperoni distribution sublime, and the overall pizza just really hit the spot. It was sliced into 8 modestly sized slices. I had no trouble finishing the pizza, though I'd not had a lot to eat today. \n\nThe price was right around $14 for the pizza and drink. It's fairly close to market rate I'd say. HotBox is an Indiana chain with a little over 20 locations all in Indiana. They offer a rewards program and also are known for their generous fundraisers for non-profits. \n\nThe absence of iced tea, the lack of a truly decent individual meal option, and a slightly, well, dirty dining room have me leaning toward a 4-star rather than a 5-star. However, it's a struggle here because that pizza was truly tasty. So, I'll likely return and see if I can fork over that 5th star. Employees are friendly and helpful - some masked, some not as the state opens up and more and more vaccinated folks go mask-free. \n\nThis definitely hit the spot and I would definitely return."

What I got was the worst tortilla chips I've ever had (from the very bottom of the bag), cold, cubed chicken pieces (barf), they forgot the bacon, shredded iceberg that looked like it was frozen, with some bbq sauce dribbled on it. The best part was the queso, which wasn't that astounding. This was below mediocre and was just straight BAD. Do not waste your time or money here."

Honestly, the steak didn't taste like steak. I don't know what it tasted like, but not steak. The toppings were rather sparse, and might I add, I ordered sour cream, salsa, and guacamole, all cost extra, (more than a couple bucks) even though these are NACHOS, and at any other nacho place, these are all included! Not to mention, got my order delivered...none of the sides I paid for were included in the order! The only good thing was that at least they put the cheese on the side, and it was good. But even the shredded lettuce and tomatoes didn't taste fresh, unfortunately. Needless to say, I will not be going back."

Between the 2 of us we hardly put a dent in the nachos.  Will def go back!"

Orange chicken and pepper beef with crab Rangoon, fried rice an an egg roll.\nOrange chicken was tender but the sauce was just vaguely sweet without much flavor.\nPepper beef had good beef bits, but I would have preferred if the peppers were less raw, sauce was bland.\nFried rice was weirdly dry and again bland.\nCrab Rangoon were far from bland but sadly disgusting and insultingly small\nEggroll was nice and crispy with tender filling. Suffered from the running theme, blandness.\nMy wait was only a few minutes thankfully, but for the cost it's hardly worth it. Stick to the other local places. You will get more bang for your buck and better food."

There are a lot of positives here. \n1) You are inadvertently taking out your frustrations on the people working at this new Fenton Mo location and THEY ARE WORKING, unlike half of America.\n2) You complain about the wait but the location is mobbed just like every new restaurant that first opens. Do you really want to eat at a restaurant that's not busy? Maybe there's a reason those restaurants aren't busy. Think about it.\n3) Then last, due to #2 above, of course they are going to be out of a lot of items. Everyone is storming the location so they are running out. \nCome on people give them a break. The newness will wear off and the waits won't be as long. They will figure out how much product is needed for the volume and after all of the negative comments the people will still be extremely friendly like they were tonight. \nENJOY!!"

He was wary at first because he tends to prefer Velveeta, not sure why. Told him to take just a little bite and he was so surprised. Said it tasted \"Better than Velveeta\", this is an ultimate compliment as this child won't eat anything that looks outside of his perception of what things should be.

The time but of caramelized onion wasn't cooked to sugared, but since there were few it was ok. \n\nThe fries were basic yet they tasted good room temperature when I got home so that's a triumph.\n\nThe broccolini is flavored well but it was rationed.\n\nThe meat and potatoes fried pizza thankfully didn't taste fried. The ingredients were premium.\n\nSo I guess I'm not as salty about the experience now that I've eaten since I am full and satisfied."

The menu sucks besides that, Was looking forward to the prime rib went on a thursday and they dont serve entrees except on the weekend. Ended up with a bologna sandwich which was good but not even close to what I wanted, Got a margarita and it came in a whiskey sipping glass. I hate when you want to like a place and they keep pissing you off. OH and dumb me thought fresh greens as a side were maybe turnip or mixed greens. Nope it was a salad with just fresh lettuce mix and dressing. I got ceasar salad now I had a second salad. They have 3 sandwich choices or pizza. M-T. If they had the 3 entrees it would be fine I think."

I had never been able to locate it because I had it at an event and knew nothing other than goat cheese. Very friendly staff and I enjoy stopping here for my wine."

Take advantage of the staff. They are always willing to answer questions, and make suggestions. The free tasting events are a great way to try a variety without commitment. The events are accompanied by a knowledgeable craftsman with each table. There are some great local discoveries if you take time to peruse the aisles. Try the samples for great hosting party ideas."

Second of all, come prepared to sample all kinds of wonderful things: from wine to spirits to dips to appetizers to chocolate. It's like a food- and alcohol-lover's paradise in here.\n\nThere is one main entrance, then to the right is a door that takes you to the wine section, and to the left is the beer section. Spirits are in the middle, kind of.\n\nThe staff seems pretty knowledgable and will recommend things to try that you might not have considered.

They don't produce much and finding a bottle is hard ... and, of course, we find a bottle in Indianapolis, Indiana at the Vine & Table. We never heard of this place and we are 200 miles away, but we had to give it a try. We called up, ordered it over the telephone and paid for it, and drove down two days later. Wow!\n\nI have been to a number of wine and spirit places, but this one was exceptional. Besides having four bottles of the particular whisky I couldn't find at other places, this establishment had aisles and aisles of wines and spirits laid out for the consumer. This is really an eye-popping arrangement of wines and spirits. Besides having the rare stuff, they have wines laid out by region and style - and they have many offerings in each category. I was really impressed with the selection. \n\nNow to the staff. We ordered over the phone, and our order was ready and marked for us when we showed up. The staff on a Sunday (admittedly a slow day) were nicer than they had any reason to be. Engaging and helpful ... the staff gets 5 stars. While I am not sure they are a fan of YELP (because YELP said they were closed when they were open) they should work with YELP. YELP will help them gain even higher ratings. \n\nAll-in-all 5-star stuff. They had the rare stuff we were looking for, the staff went over and above, the selection of other materials was overboard, and the setting is pleasant and inviting. The topper for me was the price of the rare stuff I looked for. I found it for $260 to $400 per bottle around the country - as places tried to take advantage of the demand for this rare stuff. Vine & Table asked only $199 ... the typical markup off the initial $150 MSRP. Really liked this place, especially since they are fair with their pricing. If you are in the market for wines and spirits - you have to give this place a try ... even if you are a couple of hundred of miles away. Cheers ..."

Their Islay malts are numerous and good, since many are available for tasting at their tasting bar.  Denis knows the industry and the products and is happy to share ideas, knowledge and honest opinions about whatever dram we are discussing.\n\nThey lose a star because they won't sell Capriole Farms cheese.  Some sort of utterly foolish disagreement about limited availability during peak season made the owner not sell Indiana's best cheese in their otherwise prodigiously stocked cheese cases.  Whole Foods makes it work, so clearly just some lame grudge that inconveniences me, the consumer.  \n\nThe store is split up into the market/deli half and the beer, wine, and liquor half.  I've had great experiences on the right side of the store, where the staff have special ordered items for me, and even held a bottle of Scotch for me due to my limited college student budget.  They have a huge walk-in fridge for their beer, and they carry a great selection of Indiana beer, as well as other domestic and international craft and micro-brews.

I've never come across a liquor store that does so much right and delights the customer. It says a lot that we made a special trip on our first anniversary to return. Why this is the best:\n\n-The selection: You won't find Tito's here. You'll find high quality spirits that were selected with care. You'll see some familiar spirits, you'll see some you've heard of, and you'll see a lot that you haven't tried. \n\n-The store - it's clean, spacious, well laid out, and well organized. \n\n-The staff - They are incredibly knowledgeable. Each member has their own specialties. We most often talk with Dennis, who is an expert on scotches and other whiskeys. \n\n-The attitude - They want their customers to walk away informed, happy, and to feel good about their purchase. They have a nice counter at which they've given us a number of samples. Dennis always tells us what we're drinking, if he has a relationship with the producer, what makes that drink unique, and exactly how it's made.

It looks like a small mom and pop liquor store from the outside, but then you walk in and it's much larger and much more upscale than you could guess from the outside.  Their staff is very knowledgeable, and you can tell that they know their wines and liquors by heart.  This is a place where a first-time buyer is instantly put at ease, and yet the experienced connoisseur can be assured that the salesperson knows exactly what he/she is talking about.  That's a rare combination in any business.\n\nI'm not a wine kind of guy -- brown liquors is more my speed -- but I have to say that the staff's picks for wines (whether white or red) have met with rave reviews from friends and family.  As for their whisk(e)y selection?  Some of the best selection around: at the time that I visited they had Nikka From The Barrel, an exquisite 1792 Full Proof, and an impeccable library of Scotch single malts.  Many of these selections are available for tasting at their bar, which will happily let you sample these fine spirits until you've made your selection.\n\nYou get the feeling that not only are the salespeople happy to be here and of service, they are bonded together by a genuine love of the product they sell.  And what is the world of liquor without some mythology, some mystique?  The Nikka whiskies tell the tale of Taketsuru and Rita -- a love story made beautiful by adversity, suffering, and triumph together despite a xenophobic and war-torn society.  In 1792 Full Proof is the story of a great building collapse, and the few surviving barrels that remained.  You could walk through this great library of spirits, row after row, and pick out a bottle as if it were a book on a shelf -- filled, just like that book, with tales of long patience, of determination, of showmanship, of the native lands and native hands from which the art form of the single malt was born.\n\nWe live in a disposable world today -- every encounter is single-serving, and everything we buy and consume is meant to be thrown away.  Vine & Table, in its own small way, has a way of telling this busy and chaotic world to stop, to slow down, to wait the decades until the whisky has matured and the simple pleasure of hard work has given rise to the equally simple pleasure of a good and lasting reputation.  If there are any reading this review who struggle with feelings of worthlessness, of disposability, of being here today and gone tomorrow -- know that like these fine whiskies on the shelves of Vine & Table, you too are of inherent worth ... and that your maturation process, just like mine, is not yet done.\n\nSo let our stories continue.  Let us embrace one another in solemn toast.  To good health, until the glass is empty and our hearts are full."

Vine & Table has a clear objective: showcase great product from around the world and locally to provide an experience that gets you excited to try new things.  Isn't that what life is all about? :)"

Only two workers could get in to work, but those two guys worked hard to make everyone happy. It was an oasis for most of us without heat or kight or food at home. And even though they must have been pretty tired, they kept the quality of the food they served up to the usual great standards. Kudos to those guys. We will be back."

I had the Italian sandwich and I don't think I saw hair listed on the ingredients for the sandwich, but i was in a hurry so maybe I missed it. I guess if you like hair on your sandwiches this is the place for you. I prefer my sandwich without hair, although I do like mayo. BTW, I called the hotline to let the know that they were serving hair subs and it took the guy 10 minutes to establish that they had a Fire House on route 1 in  Langhorne. The guy on the hot line did confirm that hair is not one of their standard condiments."

They won't do unnecessary procedures and are upfront about pricing (aiming to come in under quotes if possible). I have gone to other vets. They may charge less for the initial visit but they will charge more for unnecessary procedures. As Martin has been a vet for 30+ years, he knows his stuff and has seen a lot.

I'm still right about that. \n\nDr. Heather Lam has branched into pet dentistry, and our new vet is Dr. Kelly Havinga. After all this, we've determined that Dr. Havinga is a more than suitable replacement.\n\nSpartacus Jones got sick about a week ago. The long story made short? He didn't make it. Between ourselves (needles and  medications, lots of love) and the staff (all day saline treatments and supervision, lots of love) at this hospital everyone pulled all the stops to cure his early kidney failure. We spared no expense and we literally tried everything. \n\nDr. Havinga considers herself rather blunt, but I appreciate that. No bullshit. She's straight up, but not heartless. She'd spoken to every specialist she knew, but because Spartacus' lungs were filling with fluid, all our efforts were pointless. Thewords 'kidney cancer' came up. The medication required to drain his lungs, in his state, would destroy his kidneys.  He would die, no matter what we did.\n\nI desperately wanted for Spartacus to die at home, not at a vet office. Dr. Havinga provided me with three phone numbers for vets that euthanize at your home. She told us we had to do it within 48 hours, and yes, it was absolutely necessary. His suffering was terrible to witness. She gave us medication that would push the fluid from his lungs, thus easing his suffering, but it would destroy his kidneys. Nothing would stop that anyway. \n\nThe staff, ALL of them, know Spartacus and what was happening. They took really good care of him. How do I know? I saw the sorrow on their faces. I saw how he still sought their affection right to the bitter end.\n\nEven as sick as he was, he was still drawn to them for snuggles and they still pet and cuddled him, given the chance, and they called him by name. Gave him love. \n\nI paid his last bill today, and they still expressed their condolences and took a little time with me while I cried.\n\nFreya is due for shots next month. It will hurt to see this place again, but I've always trusted them, and this experience has actually fortified my feelings for them.\n\nRest in Peace Spartacus Jones. We all did what we could."

But I can tell you I'm happy with them and when my cat, Freya came home with a collapsed lung, they saved her life.\n\nWhen our other cat, Sully passed away I was devastated. It was my very first pet loss, and they were understanding and walked me through the processing of his remains. It did my heart good when I received a card from them expressing their  condolences. Inside was a copy of the Rainbow Bridge poem, and a little handmade card with Sully's paw print on it. It was a nice touch that still brings me to tears.\n\nI know Sully LOVED Dr. Lam. She has a way with furchildren. She just seems to put them at ease and she knows their personality quirks. Again, when Sully passed, she helped ease my grief. \n\nI guess I just feel like my cats and me are not just numbers and cash flow to them. I always feel like I'm taking my cats to see friends.

Overall, I think this restaurant has potential but it needs to treat customers better by first hiring someone who has strong English skills so they can effectively communicate with customers. Second don't deliver to areas you are unwilling to redeliver item to. I call the restaurant request my missing items and the manager kept stating it was too far to return for a second trip.

Not the best pizza ever but works for carryout.\n\nOnline ordering was easy but wish they accepted payments online. \n\nSign up to receive their emails and get a free cheesy bread sticks coupon.\n\nUpdate: thin crust is much better than hand-tossed!"

The chicken itself is decent. Not the best but not the worst, on par with Walmart fried chicken. The waffle fries arrived cold and no longer crispy. Obviously not freshly made for our order. Probably pulled off the buffet line. The cole slaw is equivalent to pre packaged store bought slaw.

Don't get me wrong, it is better than CiCi's and Gatti's but not much. Pizza was typical buffet pizza - fair/average.  The fried chicken was very good. Reminds me of broasted chicken.  The $15 price is not worth it to me. If this was Shakey's quality then it would be. Chicken was the highlight. However, for $1 more I can spend $16 at Monell's  (breakfast or lunch) for all you can eat chicken, 3 other entrees, homemade sides, biscuits, cornbread, dessert and drinks.  The young man running the register, Kai, has a great attitude and is very friendly. Everyone was nice and helpful. It was opening night and they ran out of ice. Having over 200 other locations they should have known on opening night to buy extra bags of ice to supplement the ice maker as I'm sure this has happened before. I'm not a fan of luke warm pop or tea.  If you are okay with CiCi's and Gatti's then you'll really like Pizza Ranch."

I think it is a combination of size and the fact that it's heavy food, this isn't diet stuff. \n\nThe tostones are clearly cooked in oil. It's not super greasy, but I felt like it weighed me down a bit by the end. That's the main reason I took some home. However, they were delicious. Here's the breakdown of the food.\n\nBEEF EMPANADA - the outer casing was light and crispy, I loved it. The beef was very good too. It's huge so you can definitely share it between two people, which is what we did.\n\nTOSTONES NACHOS - You can choose two toppings, so I went with avocado and shrimp salad. Both have a lot of tomatoes so next time I'd switch one of them for a meat. It's big and is definitely a good choice if you're hungry. The sauces are where it's at. There's a ketchup/mayo dip and a garlic one. Both are amazing and I would just eat the dip and tostones as a great snack.\n\nThe service is great. Everyone is super friendly.\n\nThey don't have free water, only water bottles, just as an fyi. They said it's because they don't have a filter for water. \n\nThis place is fantastic.

Our table was quiet because this is a legit spiritual experience! The food is AMAZING! Again on the way out we were thanked and given another message of warm welcome from the young lady taking orders. This restaurant has my business for good. Not one thing could have been better!"

On the opposite counter are many sauces to choose from if you wish. This is a small fresh kitchen clean great lunch spot.This location also offers a patio for outdoor dining.

First time I had it with the chicken chicharron and it was really delicious, the second time I had it the fried pork and it was very delicious as well. I love the garlic sauce they put on top of the mofongo, it's a little bit strong though so make sure you rinse your mouth with some mouthwash afterwards.

Having a hankering for some good latin food, I went ahead and ordered. I am absolutely not a rice kind of person at all, which is prevalent in Asian and Latin food, so the tostones meal sounded like a great option for me. I picked the Zesty shrimp since I figured it would be a nice light option. All the food came out fresh and tasty and I could tell they put alot of love in food. The shrimp was light reminded me of ceviche, fresh and tasty. Now for a restaurant that was named Tostones, I had big ecpectations for their namesake food item. They definitely did not disappoint! For one they were HUGE. I got 9 of those things in my meal. I could also tell they were homemade, really thick in density, lightly salted and fried. Buyer beware, (or rejoice depending on how you look at it) they give A LOT of them. I could only eat half of them. The rest I wrapped and froze for a tasty snack later."

I have lived all over this great nation of ours and I judge my love a city based on their buffalo wing situation. Don't get me wrong, Nashville hot chicken is fine, but classic buffalo hot wings are my favorite. I tried all of the suggested local places the first year I lived here, nothing to knock my socks off. I honestly was losing hope in the buffalo chicken wing situation, then I saw a yelp suggestions for Strikeout Wingz and boy I'm so glad this place found me. These Wings are so crisp and the buffalo sauce has that perfect flavor. I hope to see these guys competing for gold at the international Buffalo wing festival in Buffalo, NY in a few years. Through all of the turmoil here in Nashville in 2020, Strikeout Wingz has been an epically amazing bright spot. You guys should definitely give them a try!"

Wings were old & clearly had been reheated to the point they were hard & dry.  Lemon pepper was way too salty.  Garlic parm was too oily & had a weird off-taste.  I say these have potential if owners would ease up on the salt  & care enough to serve fresh food & not old food they don't want to throw away but should.  Out of the 20pc wings, only 9 were edible.  The other 11 were too old, dry, hard, black grayish color to even eat so they went into the garbage.  I won't order from this company again."

So I went online and found this place that wasn't too far. Best decision ever. The inside is decorated nicely. It's Baseball themed which I think is very unique. They have a bar you can sit at, as well as plenty of regular seating. They have big screen tvs all around so it really gives you that \"Bar atmosphere.\" The workers are friendly, and the service is surprisingly quick for it to be a smaller business. If you're like me and you enjoy smaller wings over those gigantic ones you'll most definitely love this place. They have a variety of sauces, but I went for my usual lemon pepper and it was SO GOOD. They even let you get the wing sauces/seasonings on your fries. We got to meet the owner, and he's so friendly. It's always a plus when the business is black owned!

Only negative thing I'll say is that I wish their wings had a little more meat. A couple of the wings I've had had barely any meat and I felt ripped off. The sauces I've tried are the lemon pepper, sweet & sassy, and garlic parm. All of which were phenomenal! Their fries come with a tasty seasoning on them which is a plus as well.

We waited at the counter for about 5 mins. We had to find someone to help us with our order. When we did find someone, she was very apologetic and made sure our food was properly bagged and gave us a little extra for the wait. The Food: worth the wait. If you don't like your wings well seasoned, this is not the place for you. The seasoning and taste definitely packs a punch. The Buffalo chicken fries are my favorite menu item.

He was so polite and respectful. That made me want to support the business more and write a review! \n\nAside from that, I called in my order and it was a ready and correct in about 10 minutes from when I called it in. I got the sweet & sassy 6pc. The wings had the right amount of sauce and the sauce was delicious! I wanted to do half hot and half sweet and sassy just in case it wasn't good but they don't split sauces on a 6pc. Thankfully I wasn't disappointed! Seasoned fries were also delicious! One thing I had to remember to do was ask for ranch, it didn't automatically come in the box but thankfully not an up charge! \n\nHonestly I would support this business and eat here for all my wing cravings! \n\nOnly suggestion is to get homemade ranch rather than the commercialized containers. Not very tasty but sufficed for my meal. \n\nY'all are doing amazing! Thank you!"

I called them earlier to make sure they did happy hour and they said yes but didn't mention to me that it was at the bar only (had I known I wouldn't have even gone). We still sat down and ordered and when the bill came we split it between two cards. When we got our checks we saw that she put the entire charge on one card and then half the charge on another card??? When we talked to the server she told us it was some prior authorization but she actually just charged us wrong. Then we spoke to the manager Megan who re charged us the correct amount and said to keep an eye on our credit card statements and if anything was wrong to call her. The week after we both checked our cards and were double charged. When we tried calling the number she gave us it didn't work. So basically not worth the effort."

We had 730 reservations and we got there about 20 minute early.  We checked in, fully expecting to have to wait for our table, which we did.  Not a problem.  But they seemingly forgot about us.  Finally, after several other 730 reservations came in and were seated immediately,  at 740 we reminded them that we were there and they sat us right away.  \n\nOur waitress was really bad.  She pretty much ignored us the whole time.  She got our drink order and we waited and waited and waited. And she finally came back to take our drink order again which we reminded her that we already ordered our drinks.  We also orders chips and guacamole.  We ate all the chips and guacamole because we were hungry and our waitress was nowhere to be founds. Finally she came back and said oh your orders will be right up when we hadn't even ordered our dinner yet. So we ordered our dinner.  We also ordered another round of drinks which didn't come until halfway into us eating our dinner.  \n\nThe food was actually really good.  I had the chicken tacos and my husband had the fish tacos. The service was terrible.  The hostess was all over the place and seemed very disorganized.  Our waitress was absent pretty much the whole time and didn't seem to know or remember what she was doing.  It was very frustrating.  We even decided against another round of drinks and dessert because the service was just terrible.  \n\nIt was a cute place, but the music was super loud. Thumping loud.  I enjoyed the music, but thought it could've been toned down a bit.  \n\nOverall, good food, terrible service, ok ambiance."

I felt like I was at some cheap college bar getting a well drink. The food was just super boring. My friends ordered the empanadas which they said it was pretty good. I ordered the cauliflower tacos and the flavors if they tried to put together honestly was like they were just doing too much!  I've never heard of buffalo cauliflower with refried beans it just doesn't sound good and it didn't taste good either. The guacamole was horrible. I mean I don't know what happened back there in the kitchen I'm not trying to be mean right now but they really need to update her guacamole skills. You can't be a Mexican restaurant and suck at guacamole- it's a staple. But what I will say is the ambience in the restaurant is really nice. I'll give them props for that. Wish I had a better experience. IDK  maybe it was just because it was their opening weekend and that's the reason why everything wasn't as great as it could be but I'm hoping that with the feedback maybe they'll revitalize their menu and make some changes."

I swear we waited at least an hour from the time we were seated to when it was time too leave for someone to come by. I want to say we waited at least 30 minutes to close the bill before i ended up having too grab another waitress to see about her closing us up.

My friend and I had just came from a happy hour before and ate so we really just came to drink so we decided to try their margarita tower that a was around $60 for around 80 oz. it was pretty much about 4 drinks for each of of us. We decided to go with a strawberry flavor which turned out pretty good. Since you have to order a food item to dine we just got a order of street corn that was tasty. I definitely want to go back to try more food options like the tacos and or nachos etc."

I will say this - I've NEVER had such good service at a restaurant before. Our waitress/server, Imani, was an absolute delight! She was warm and genuine, kept checking up on us throughout the night, super chatty and friendly, and literally went out of her way to make our night better in every regard - food, drinks, company, you name it. The bartender and manager were super nice and friendly as well! It's definitely a place I will be going back to and it's worth every penny we spent!"

You can choose 3 flavors on the menu. I liked the guava, classic, and blueberry basil. I chose to go with the house tequila bc why not, it's cheaper. They list up to 3 types of tequila (low to high) so definitely clarify which one you want to go with. I personally couldn't taste much of the tequila in my flights and when I ordered a classic margarita - it just tasted sugary and sour from the mix, slight bummer but oh well! I read previous reviews about their drinks being too sugary and barely any tequila. \n\nChips and pico were good! For $9 they give you a good amount. Chips could've been more crispy - or maybe it's supposed to taste kinda stale? O.o I used to work at El Vez so maybe I'm used to that chip style and I go to Mission Taqueria a lot so hmm... idk \n\nThe prices on the menu seemed a bit overpriced compared to similar restaurants in the city... they didn't have a happy hour menu but that's ok. The chicken quesadilla costs $18 I don't think it should've been $18 IMO and honestly, I think that's the most I've ever paid for a chicken quesadilla. I didn't feel entirely bad about it because it tasted good, was filled with cheese and veggies and the portion is big."

Made reservations for 7:30 and was informed to wait in line for the haunted house which would only be 7-9mins. And we could go have dinner without any issues. When we made it into the restaurant the hostess told us we were late and we'd need to now wait. After explaining what staff informed us, she then said it would only be 5 mins.  We purchased tickets online and with the purchase we received complimentary drinks and dessert. The drinks was watered down, didn't taste a hint of alcohol and the dessert is a mini chocolate chip cookie with chocolate pudding on top. \n\nThere were 4 of us so we ordered the taco meal.

I have so much food left over that I didn't even have to bother with ordering a dinner.  One think I did opt in on was the extra sauce, do this. It will take your food journey one step beyond, and you deserve this. The mac and cheese was so full of cheese that it was stringy. The toasted ravioli arrived at the hospital still crunchy and the cake..... wow! \n\nI will be trying this again one day. When we are not hospital bound."

I got the ahi cubes and spicy ahi with an assortment of toppings (cucumber, edamame, ginger, masago and furikake). You are also able to select two sauces. I got the Kai's sauce and ponzu. The spicy ahi had a good kick to it and is prepared lomi style. I actually really liked it! The ahi cubes were okay but didn't have a lot of flavor to it. I couldn't taste the ponzu at all. I wish poke places here mixed the fish with the sauce and toppings. I also hope to see some more traditional poke mix-ins. \n\nWhile this isn't like poke bowls you would find from Hawai'i, it is nice to have a healthier option close to work.

Ordering is only through delivery companies like DoorDash and UberEats, which have their own problems and fees. We thought we'd try them with ordering from Uber Eats and having a couple combo meals with baos and dumplings. Each combo was $15.98 and the dumplings were $5.99, expensive for lunch. First combo: Kung Pao spicy chicken with Mongolian beef and teriyaki chicken baos, and a teriyaki chicken with bbq Berkshire Pork baos, and an order of ginger-chicken dumplings (potstickers). Well, the pork ones were by far the best and most flavorful. The chicken and beef baos were at best tolerable. Picture teriyaki chicken or innocuously spiced beef whizzed in a food processor and then piped into a wheat donut-like bun. Absolutely no texture and no flavor except spice and soy sauce. The dumplings were no better than and looked exactly like the ones you can get in Costco's freezer section. The \"Chinese\" food was really pretty pathetic. The portions were small and the only way we could tell the difference between the teriyaki chicken and Kung Pao chicken were the peanuts scattered on top. Neither dish had any discernible chunks of chicken or vegetables, just a very heavy dose of soy sauce and red chili flakes, and a few slices of green onion which I just noticed. As for the delivery, the service charge PLUS the delivery charge PLUS tip was $21, and that was before the food charges! Overall, this was a highly disappointing lunch for nearly $60. Hubby liked the pork buns and wanted me to give them an extra star just because they're different. Ok, but I'm 100% positive we can get frozen bao at either Costco or one of the Asian markets in town which will be just as good and cheaper, AND any of the teriyaki shops or Chinese restaurants in town have better food. So there you have it, a pretty comprehensive review. This is a new operation and I wish them well, but I don't believe we'll order from them again if I have to pay $20+ before the food costs."

It's a small shack that sells Korean BBQ foods. They are a little bit pricy, but for the proportions you are getting (the flavors are absolutely amazing), it is completely worth it.

                "text": "Don't expect what you are used to or what their website pictures show.  I got the orange chicken as I usually like orange chicken in all the iterations from various restaurants I have tried. But what I got was neither like any orange chicken I have had previously or what was in their picture on their online menu. What i got was a bowl of rice and two table spoons of hard dark meat most of which was in tiny fragments such that it felt like I was eating ground chicken rather than individually cut pieces. I can only assume this was what was scrap meat left over from nicer cuts of chicken. The sauce was somewhat sweat but flat and flavorless. I was so disappointed as I really wanted to love it and be able to support a local business (though to be fair it is a nation wide chain which I should have known before ordering.). I also ordered two boa - teriyaki chicken and cheese burger. They were very light and fluffy consisting mostly of dough with a tiny amount of stuffing.  The teriyaki tasted more like BBQ chicken (and perhaps I got the wrong one) and I don't personally like BBQ so I can't fairly judge that if it was BBQ by mistake. If it was supposed to be teriyaki it was a pretty big miss for me. I also tried the cheese burger boa as I thought it wiuld be fun to try something both very familiar (Ive had dumplings and Ive had cheese burgers) but also unique. Again the dough to stuffing ratio means you are going to get 90% dough so most of your bites will not include cheese burger. But the dough is nicely done - very fluffy and light in taste and texture. The cheeseburger stuffing is simple and the combination of both elements done well and simply adds up to a unique yet familiar experience. Just as the orange chicken skimped on the chicken leaving one to feel underwhelmed you may also find yourself underwhelmed with the amount of cheeseburger in your cheeseburger boa (teriyaki/BBQ??? Chicken as well). \n\nI am 100% certain I would never purposely order their orange chicken again or likely anything as it feels they skimp and short you at every turn. (Which I guess is to expect with some chain restaurants). Which is too bad bc the burger boa could have been really good if there had just been burger in them. So i guess... I wouldn't likely order boa again unless they were on a massive sale and I would certainly avoid the teriyaki chicken. \n\nA real bummer as I so wanted to find another place for yummy eats."

Virtually impossible to drink it without clogging the straw. \n\nWe spent almost $100 on food/drink that was equal parts good, equal parts disappointing. Even though she wasn't knowledgeable on the new menu, the bartender was very sweet. \n\nI would only go back if there was a good happy hour which would give me a chance to try the food again.

We ordered a variety of plates to include yucca fritters, patatas bravas, creamy rice, grilled octopus and escargot. The escargot were very good, no complaints. The creamy rice was very flavorful, but there wasn't anything creamy about it. The yucca fritters were undercooked but the sauce was very good. The octopus was extremely overcooked, but the potatoes and asparagus it came with were perfect. The patatas have nothing to do with patatas bravas, which are normally fingerling potatoes. These were simply JoJo potatoes which were decent, but not with Spanish food. All in all, I'm hoping this was just all new restaurant jitters.

This had that in spades). \n\nGot a soft taco. There's pork, there's some veggies, squeezed some lime on it, took a bite, and somehow the corn tortilla had more taste than anything in it. It was incredible, I didn't know something could be that tasteless. \n\nGot the chilli rellenos. They were soggy, but that happens. The problem was the first inch or 2 of each had that hardness you get from microwaved food. The filling was mostly tasteless shredded chicken, and the bit of cheese in there was not melted. I guess there was a sauce on the outside?  I saw sauce. I didn't taste sauce. \n\nIt came with rice, which to their credit, was properly cooked!\n\nIt also came with beans which were both a bit undercooked and tasted like someone throw a can of beans in a pot for a few mins with water and declared, \"good enough!\"\n\nWe ordered the churros, which were pictured with whipped cream and did not include any other description. Instead, it came without whipped cream but with a kind of gross cream cheese filling. \n\nAnd finally, we ordered 2 mexican cokes (you know, the glass bottle ones with real sugar and not corn syrup) and were given 2 regular cokes, plastic bottles, corn syrup, and all. \n\nIt was an utter failure every step of the way. \n\nThere's far better Mexican places within a 20 min drive of here, go to one of those instead."

We went here for lunch and had the sweetest of waitress, polite service, great food, clean and nice decor. \nWe had complimentary chips and salsa. \nWe ordered chips and guacamole and tamales to start. Homemade chips and guacamole were good. Tamales came 2 with order. 1 pork 1 chicken both were also good. \n\nFor lunch, I had steak chimichanga which came with rice and black beans. \nMy daughter had Camarones (red hot spicy sauce) with shrimp which also came with rice and black beans. \nThey rice was light, fluffy and full of flavor, definitely homemade. \nWe both loved our lunch and ate till we were full and still took home leftovers. \nFor dessert we had churros which came with a sweet flavored ice cream and whip cream. \n\nWe will definitely be back since they are open for business during these crazy times!!"

Let's just say taco bell would've been a better option than here for simple TACOS. \n\nI ordered chicken, birria, and street tacos (carnitas). \n\nLet's start off with the birria tacos. it came with a liquid i'm assuming was for dipping them in. looks nothing like how it's supposed to. I attached a pic of what the sauce and tacos are supposed to look like. i ended up mixing some of the chicken within the birria but by the second taco i couldn't take such a bland taste of the birria. i dipped it in their \"sauce\" and it still tasted like nothing... now my taco was just soaked with even less flavor. Not to mention an unknown red sauce in a smaller container which had the tiniest bit of taste which still did the taco no justice, even dumped the whole thing on the second taco as well. \n\nThe chicken tacos were better..... soggy but better. definitely had more taste. Nothing really more to say.\n\nThe street tacos were the same as well. No taste and sauce that didn't help. \n\nI'm very glad the people that had a good experience did, but my experience was not like theirs and i only tried this place because of the good reviews. As someone like me who is hispanic, this place disappointed HEAVILY. \n\nAny item off of taco bell's menu would've been better than what i had from this place."

                "text": "Full disclosure: I've only eaten here during the weekend buffet that they do (I think that this is actually Friday-Sunday, either out of a misunderstanding of the concept of a weekend or as part of a conscious effort to defy it) because home is the southerly parts of Pinellas and, given the existence of thirty-some miles of miscellaneous urban nonsense between where I am and where they are (I need to take three interstates to get here, each more stultifying than the last), it might as well be in one of the Dakotas, or else some forbidding slope in Kamchatka, where the wolves howl and the night does not end. Thus, I've never been here for a normal meal and ordered a normal item off the menu like a normal person. But I've been to the buffet many times, since the place is right across the street (or *almost* just across the street) from Lettuce Lake Park, a lovely place to wander and gawp at the alligators and weird birds for the princely sum of $2.\n\nUtterly full disclosure: If I have any tiny trace of blood from the Indian subcontinent, it's been so diluted and diffused by generation upon generation of angry people who make angry-looking buildings that it probably now couldn't fill a grasshopper's coffee mug, and I'm pretty sure that I've never been within three thousand miles of Delhi. So I have no claim to judge what constitutes authentic Indian food of any stripe, and anyone who does should feel free to snort contemptuously and consign this review to whatever part of their brain they use to store voicemails about extending their car warranty or the phone books that regularly land in their yards and absorb rain and reclaimed water until they're a soupy mess.\n\nBut, even given the above caveats, this very well might be the best Indian restaurant I've ever visited. I've had a long and checkered career of visiting Indian restaurants, from the dismal downtown buffet where you eat too much chicken tikka for no discernible reason (it does not spark joy or create satisfaction, but still you keep eating it) and enter a state of such profound drowsiness that you immediately understand that you will never get anything important done for the rest of the day, to the smalltown restaurant putting on airs with white tablecloths and silver where the most complex item on the menu is saag paneer, to the grotesque and misbegotten Midwestern late-Fifties steadily-collapsing concrete-and-sheet-metal monstrosity where beef vindaloo (???) is on the menu and the servers mispronounce the names of dishes with the insouciant confidence of the utterly damned. So, whatever mitigating factors might be in place, I stand by my pronouncement.\n\nThe buffet, and the menu in general (which, again, I haven't sampled at length, but have browsed) seem to make reluctant concessions to American taste, offering some of the usual suspects (butter chicken, tikka masala, whatever vindaloo), but seem to be mostly interested in going beyond that. The weekend buffet reliably has goat curry, which is wonderful (and spicy!) and not something that is regularly included in the genre, and the chili chicken (which is usually interpreted as some soupy, sticky variant on Chinese food, as per its origins) is a sort of dry, fried, spice-encrusted dish, gloriously addictive. And many dishes whose names are unfamiliar to me--a sort of rice pudding, but not the kheer that is easily found at every five-and-dime buffet across the nation, instead a complex, spicy concoction with caraway and green chile, or a set of fritters (labeled \"baby corn,\" though I'm not at all sure that's what they were) that become transcendent when dipped in one of the array of lovely sauces that they provide. And it's actually spicy, or, rather, many dishes are (the butter chicken is still, predictably, bland and inoffensive), which is damn near impossible to find in an Indian restaurant around these parts--even some of the buffet items have a decent bite. And the little (free!) cups of chai that they provide--strong, but not too sweet, not like the milky sugared-up lattes that you get at Starbucks. And this, and that, and more. Yes, it's slightly spendy (currently around $15 for the buffet), but you don't eat here every day and, perhaps, like me, you've driven for a while to be here, in a weird abandoned parking lot adjacent to a Holiday Inn Express adjacent to a huge tech park... so it's probably worth it.\n\nBut if you've just skipped to the end, here, in hopes of discovering whether this restaurant is good and whether you should eat here, the answer is, definitely, yes and yes. If you are even remotely intrigued by Indian food, and if you do not shrink from the notion of capsaicin-laced food as if it were the machinations of the devil himself, you owe it to yourself to visit this place. Yes, it's in the parking lot of a hotel, and it's tiny, and you don't know where you are or what's what (welcome to Florida). Just go in and eat the goat curry, you weirdo."

We all opted for the ch\u00e9 (Vietnamese dessert drink) and the pandan waffle because I love pandan.  I had the fruit addict, which I found pretty sweet (almost too sweet when drank vs eaten with a spoon).  I think I'll try adjusting the sugar level next time. I really liked the pandan jelly.  Not sure how this is considered a drinkable dessert since most of the items in the cup doesn't even fit into a straw.  My brother had the Bambu special.  He didn't like it because he thought it was too sweet.  My cousin had the longan sunrise. Surprisingly, she found it too bland and had to add some honey to it, but she liked it otherwise. \n\nThe pandan waffle was nice and chewy,  although I couldn't really taste the pandan. \n\nLost a star for the incredibly slow service. Took us around 20 min to get our order.  The slow service is a bit of a deterrent for a repeat visit, although we found out that you can call in your order ahead of time to avoid the wait around."

With the covid situation right now, they are only offering takeout and all the tables are placed in a way to allow for social distancing.\n\nI ordered two types of their Che (#2 Bambu Combo and #6 Fruit Addict). Che is a dessert drink. It was like a shaved ice dessert on top of coconut milk with many types of toppings in a cup. They were both very refreshing and delicious. Each had its own unique taste. I was surprised at how filling they were. \n\nI also ordered the Pandan Waffle. This was bomb! Very crunchy and it had a mochi texture. Definitely recommend getting this. \n\nPro Tip: The Che isn't too sweet so do not reduce the sugar level even though you have an option to.\n\nOverall I had a great experience. Service was friendly and efficient. Their dessert is a perfect treat to get while walking around Whyte. I'll likely come back in the future to try the other items on the menu."

It looked like the NYC slices of my dreams, and I appreciated the fact that other local food reviewers were the ones sharing the photos and rave reviews, not the restaurant itself. Its own social media is vague and humorous -- again, reminiscent of a good pizza place in the Northeast.\n\nI got the Sweet Heat pie -- capicola, jalape\u00f1os and honey -- and an order of buffalo wings. Both exceeded my already high expectations. I usually don't get jalape\u00f1os on any food I order out because measurements are usually way off what I'd prefer -- either way too spicy or two jalape\u00f1o slices on the whole thing. This was the absolute perfect amount. And despite the pizza being huge (and not too expensive for the size at $22), the crust maintained that perfect thinness without being too crispy or floppy.\n\nThe wings that were wings, not drums, were great, but that's always a preference thing for me and my own fault for not asking for all wings. The buffalo sauce was also the perfect amount of heat to still be able to taste the pizza in the next bite. I'll have to try the highly-favored centennial wings next time -- whatever that sauce is.

Midnight Oil is the latter. Citizens of Yelp, rejoice, you have found Nashville's most faithful NY slice. \n\nWe ordered a pie: half pepperoni, half sweet heat. Upon first bite, the first thing you will notice is the perfectly crisped dough. Just the right touch of crunch before giving way to a marriage of expertly portioned cheese and sauce. This is the kind of pie that is able to impress even with no toppings. However, you would be doing yourself a disservice to ignore the lovely honey-spicy combo that the sweet heat pie provides.

                "text": "An almost but not quite perfect representation of New York slice joint pizza.\n\nHaving moved here from NYC finding good pizza in Nashville has been...well, like finding good BBQ up there. Five Points does a solid representation of a traditional New York pie, with fresh mozzarella and a wide variety of toppings. Midnight Oil, on the other hand, comes very close to nailing what you'd get at a classic NYC slice joint: the kind of place where you order at the counter and receive 18\" slices of simply-topped pizza on white paper plates. It's less fancy, but no less difficult to pull off well.\n\nAnd Midnight Oil comes very close to doing so. Their crust is light and airy without being overly floppy. It didn't have the crisp bottom that you ideally want from this style of pizza, but most NYC slice joints don't achieve that consistently and it still had a nice foldability to it. The balance of crust, sauce, and cheese was spot on, with no one element overshadowing the others.\n\nThe only place where Midnight Oil really falls short is in their sauce. NYC pizza sauce has a slight sweetness to it that was missing here; instead it was overly seasoned and on the bitter side. It was actually more akin to what you'd find on a Chicago-style thin crust pizza, but while it works well for that style it's out of place here. I noticed earlier reviewers mentioning that the sauce was too sweet for them, so I wonder if this place had actually nailed the New York style to begin with but changed in response to complaints from people with no idea of how this style of pizza is supposed to taste. I hope not.\n\nAside from the sauce, my only suggestion to the owners of Midnight Oil would be to add garlic knots and a Grandma pie to the menu. And maybe train your staff to have a more surly attitude for full effect - the service was far too quick and courteous for New York pizza! \n\nIn all seriousness, while I hope they'll improve their sauce, this was still a damn good pizza and I will definitely be back for more."

And really friendly staff - Tony was incredibly welcoming and kind to us first-time customers!\n\nTheir standard pizza is an extra-large 16\" New York style (crispy-chewy thin crust, baked in a non-wood pizza oven), and the topping style is meticulous and generous - every single pie I saw come out of the kitchen looked perfectly photoshoot ready. I love seeing a kitchen take such pride in their product!\n\nOrdered a few beers (~$5/each) and a build-your-own pizza with capicola & jalape\u00f1o ($21) - which is basically a *no honey* mod of the \"Sweet Heat\" which ends up being $1 less than their signature pie, which is cool. This pizza was fantastic and well-balanced. The outer crust was ideal - equal parts crispy and chewy - but toward the inside I would have a preferred a little more baked-in doneness. The droopiness of the inside of the slices necessitated some folding of the slice while eating, which turns pizza into a calzone experience of sorts and hits your tastebuds in unintended areas. Because of all of the folding, I tried to conserve the pizza because I knew how good it would be reheated by the slice on a hot pizza stone at home. Knowing this, grabbing a pizza-to-go from Midnight Oil is an obvious 5-star move if you enjoy the true NY slice experience (toasting up individual slices). The next time I eat a pizza at the restaurant I will ask for it well-done or \"extra toasted\" to see if it's improved. For to-go pizzas, normal doneness is perfect if you're going to toast it up on a pizza stone yourself.\n\nThe capicola here is such a unique and quality pizza topping - and because it's a real muscle meat (not a processed tube like pepperoni or salami) it reduces the guilt factor in eating this pizza. Of course I'd prefer a sprouted grain crust instead of the white flour they use, but hey - as long as I don't eat white flour every day..."

I brought it to a party and everyone was loving it and asking me where I got it. Score, my new favorite pizza spot. The second time I ordered I decided just to get one for myself and I was going to eat it over the week, such a great deal! But, I ordered through the web site (like before) and saw there was a \"sub for cauliflower crust\" option. I was like sweet, I like cauliflower crust. I show up to pick up the pizza and they hand me a box that is probably 1/3 the size of the first pizza I ordered. I was visibly confused and questioned the person and they essentially gave the reasoning that the cauliflower is much more expensive. Ok, fair enough, but there was zero information on the site as to the size of the pizza, regular or not when I check that option. What if I'm ordering for 6 people and not one or two? Knowing that option will reduce the size from XL to personal size might be important. Just maybe. If the person had remotely attempted to fix the problem I'd be 5 stars all day. But instead he kind of just looked at me and we sat in silence for a second until I awkwardly said ok and left. I'll continue to come here because the food is good and it has great vibe, but I hope they provide a little more info on the ordering site so people don't have the same disappointment I did.

Because the show didn't start 'til 8:00, we planned to have drinks and dessert during the show, as it was advertised that both food and drink would be available. The event was upstairs, so we headed up there upon arrival at about 7:30, and the space was cute, but the carpet on the stairs was absolutely filthy, and some of the booths near the back were missing padding. We sat down and asked our server for the wine list and a couple waters. \n\nTo start, I was disappointed that a supposedly nice French restaurant had only ONE cabernet sauvignon, and it was cheap. No syrah or petite sirah. And, seriously? $10/glass for Bogle wine? With all the local wine options we have in SB? Bogle is $8.99 a BOTTLE at Trader Joe's this week... Seems inappropriate to serve super cheap wine next to a selection of $20-$45 a la carte dinner plates. Whatever wine list is on their website is not AT ALL the wine list we were given, as the one we got was much smaller and very much lacking.\n\nSadly, we never got to try the food or order more than one glass of wine because, despite asking for one and telling our server we planned to order crepes and coffee for dessert, he never brought us a menu. The older gentleman sitting next to us had to ask three times for a menu, and I'm still not sure he ever got one. We sat for more than 2 hours during the show. Never got water refills, never got to order dessert or coffee or ANYTHING. At the end, we had to ask the server for the check for our sad glass of wine, and he in turn had to ask us what we'd had because he'd failed to write us a ticket. We could have walked right out the door, and no one would have known we hadn't paid.\n\nAll in all, the comedy show was great, but the restaurant experience was pretty disappointing.

The staff is friendly and attentive.  BIG UP's to Crystal and the Chef. The Owner Aunt B and her daughter.  All a bunch of nice people.  I will continue to support B.O.B! If you ever find yourself in the Philadelphia area or traveling on I 95 north of Delaware,  stop in for some of their HOMEMADE deliciousness. You won't be disappointed.  When they have it.......TRY their 7 UP CAKE. It's off the chart"

Did not really taste too much espresso either but again it was so tasty so it's worth it. The raspberry coconut bar had a good amount of coconut in it which I liked, but the berry part was a little too sweet in my opinion. Also, I noticed that they did not openly label their baked goods that had nuts in them, so I was surprised when there were walnuts in the espresso cookie. I'm not allergic but would hate for someone who has allergies to be surprised like that, so just make sure you ask about nuts when you are ordering."

The concept is Indian fusion mixed with Mexican food and it sounded absolutely delicious. They offer a variety of wraps, burritos, bowls, and even poutine with classic Indian flavors and dishes. \n\nMy partner and I each ordered the super bowl which was such a great deal at only $15 you could choose 3 proteins and a base, and we were completely stuffed.  I got the butter chicken with chickpeas (chana) and saag paneer, topped with yogurt and the medium chutney.  My partner got the chicken tikka masala with beans (rajma) and saag paneer and yogurt as well, but with the hot chutney. The chutneys were nice and spicy and really added a great flavor to our bowls (the medium one was more herby in flavor, the hot was more peppery).  We tried each individually before mixing it all together, and each component was really delicious except for maybe the saag paneer, we weren't too crazy about as the cheese curds were very small. Overall, super pleased though with them! \n\nOur poutine was alright- ours unfortunately came without the cheese it was supposed to be topped with? We ordered a small kids' size just to try it because we were really intrigued, and we topped it with chorizo tikka, jalape\u00f1os, katchumber (cucumber, tomatoes, onions) and pickled onions. The fries were actually really great, nice and crispy and delicious but overall it kind of was nothing special, just fries topped with things. We should have in hindsight ordered a more curry based meat topping to make it closer to poutine. \n\nI would definitely recommend them as a quick bite / takeout place, I could see this being a great stop for a hearty lunch for anyone and it for sure gets huge bonus points for uniqueness!"

Just flavorless like they took chickpeas right out the can, undrained, and sprinkled some garam masala in it. I've eaten channa plenty of times at Indian restaurants and it doesn't taste like that.\n\nThe curry potatoes made up for the tasteless channa somewhat.

Second, I've been coming here for years having worked in the immediate area.\n\nThis is your standard fast food mall kiosk except it's run by a Vietnamese family, not a chain. It's your standard fare like honey chicken, beef with bell peppers, lo mein, fried rice, etc. They also have some local fare as specials like fried catfish or pork chops. What I like about this place from a food perspective is that they make pretty much everything fresh for you except at lunch-time and you're ordering a high demand item like honey chicken. \n\nThat combined with the fact that the family that runs the place is unfailingly nice, super hard working, and very efficient. So all this combined makes this place a four star rating (again, for what it is - a food kiosk in a mall!). If you're in the immediate area and looking for some quick and solid chinese food, you really can't go wrong."

If I could give this place zero stars I would because the crepes were that horrible!  We ordered the vegetarian crepes which had disgusting frozen spinach, canned olives, canned mushroom, and hardly any mozzarella cheese and one tiny piece of a unripe tomato. It was basically a canned sliced olive crepe because the rest of the ingredients were cut in tiny pieces you could barely taste it and the ingredients were not mixed together. \n\nThere was absolutely no taste or flavor and it was grossly put together.  There was no seasoning, no herbs and cheap quality ingredients! The crepe has balsamic vinegar on top of it which was all I could taste was the sourness of the vinegar!  When I cut into the crepe it was so thin in cut into the paper that was underneath it.  The owner had his wife and two sons working there.  The older son probably in his teens was behind the counter while his dad (The owner) was showing him how to make the crepe and the the other son around 10 years old served us the crepes, I was served my crepe first than 10 minutes later my husband got his and we were the only ones in the store. \n\nThe owner came to our table and asked how we liked the crepes?   He noticed that the crepes were barely touched and  I told him there was no flavor and the ingredients taste like everything was out of a can and he said \"you ordered the vegetable crepe that is why it has no taste!\"  I was shocked at his reaction and obviously he is not a good business person when it comes to customer service.  If that's the case than tell us next time not to order it because it is a horrible tasting crepe and save us a lot of money because the crepes were very expensive and they were horrible tasting!  We will definitely not be back and we definitely do not recommend. Shame on the owner for serving horrible tasting food and very poor customer service!  AVOID AT ALL COST AND STAY AWAY!"

It's a cute little place with a full bar... looks like a nice place to hang out with friends for drinks.  However, I would definitely NOT be going back for dinner.  Sushi rolls were ok (can't remember the names, but we tried one with eel and advocado, one with spicy tuna, and the one with soft shelled crab), but non-sushi menu items were a definite NO-GO.   For some odd reason, we were craving shrimp so we ordered the shrimp cocktail as an appetizer (yes, I know, not a typical Japanese dish).  The shrimp was sauteed with green peppers, mushrooms, and onions. (This should have been a warning since generally shrimp cocktail is just boiled shrimp served cold with cocktail sauce - although this one did come with cocktail sauce.)  My husband ordered the chicken teriyaki, which didn't resemble any teriyaki dish we've seen in California. This order had dried up pieces of chicken (looked like it was cooked twice or something), was sauteed the same way as the \"shrimp cocktail\", and seasoned with the same type of sauce, which isn't the usual slightly sweet teriyaki sauce we've grown accustomed to.  My dad ordered the seafood teriyaki, which was also cooked up the same way as the \"shrimp cocktail\" and chicken dish!   I also ordered the tempura entree, but my order of tempura was never brought out, so I can't comment on it.   (Luckily, mom didn't order anything off the dinner menu.)   We decided to just get the check and finish dinner somewhere else. \n\nTo be fair, some other table ordered sashimi and sushi (nigiri style, not rolls), which looked good when the server brought it out.

The menu was pricier than other sushi restaurants in St. Louis, but we were given free miso soup with our order (ME LIKES miso soup).\n\nWe ordered several rolls, including California (seemed to be pre-made a day ahead) and Philadelphia (the salmon wasn't fresh).  \n\nThe eel roll was the only roll that seemed okay, but with eel,  if it doesn't smell it's hard to tell.  The shrimp tempura was greasy, but we've been experiencing greasy tempura at many of the local sushi joints lately.  So, we may rule tempura out altogether.  This wasn't a thriller."

Rather than just put salt on the edamame, they put crushed red pepper and some other stuff so it's got a little spice to it.  It's so good, and I don't know why other sushi joints haven't thought to do a similar thing. You can't get such good, unique edamame anywhere else!  \n\nI think the sushi is good also. Sometimes they seemed to change around the recipes for certain rolls.  So we'd really like the spicy tuna roll sometimes but other times it wasn't as good.  But overall I think the sushi was better than other places around that area.  I don't know if they still have it on their menu, but the fried ghost roll was really good.  \n\nThe drinks are also really unique and yummy.  There's one with crushed kiwi in it that's very tasty.  It'd be a great place to go for drinks with friends because you'd never have to fight for a drink at the bar, and the drinks are great and never watered down.\n\nFrom my experience Modai is usually pretty empty, but that's probably because they are sort of on the outskirts of the Loop area, so the foot traffic isn't as heavy as other parts of the Loop.  And while it can be a little more pricey than some other STL sushi places, I think it's much better than the other sushi restaurants in the Loop.  I went to the other sushi restaurant in the Loop and it was awful. I don't know why people go there -- probably because it's just got a better location.  But Modai is definitely good and unique, and I'd definitely recommend that people give it a try."

I was super excited that there is a new addition to the Northeast area. Since Moon Flower House is inside the shopping center, parking definitely isn't a issue. \n\nWhen I get there at 11:25am, this place was already packed. I order a Fried Chicken Sandwich(not spicy), a Breaded Shrimp Sandwich, a order of Drum Sticks, a Pumkin Cakes, and New Orland BBQ Chicken. I repeatedly told the cashier that I want a non spicy Fried Chicken Sandwich. After I paid and saw my receipt, it says spicy for my Chicken Sandwich and my pumpkin cakes were missing. I went back to the cashier and told her about the mistake. One of her male colleagues say he couldn't make any changes, that's when I got upset and pointed at that girl that I say over three times about the sandwich being non spicy. It took them 25 minutes just to sort that out and correct my order. At that point, i was like it might take another 15 minutes for them to add my pumpkin cakes so I decided not to get them this time. \n\nI placed a order around 11:30am, my order wasn't done until 1:15pm. I was dying of starvation so I hurriedly left. Their sandwiches are very tasty but they are also small. One was for my mom, and the other for my brother, both likes their sandwiches, again it just wasn't enough for a meal. I order the drum sticks and BBQ chicken for myself. I like the drum sticks, let's not get it confused with the leg drum, their version of drum sticks are the wing drum. The BBQ Chicken are the most flavorless chicken ever. The chicken wasn't even BBQ, it is baked chicken, i gave it to my dumpster instead. I wanted to order desserts and drinks, but none were available. \n\nToday was their grand opening. Whoever manages this place need to train their staffs, bc they were everywhere. Ppl shouldn't wait closed to 2 hours for 2 sandwiches and 2 side orders. Ran out of chicken sandwich at 1pm is insane, are you even prepared for opening? Why even open without half of your menu? Unbelievable!"

Both I got spicy and the coating on the chicken was crispy while the chicken itself was juicy. It wasn't overly spicy but enough to get a kick. Next the chicken sandwich tasted great.  I also enjoyed the shrimp which was very crispy.  They seem to know there way around a fryer at this place.  I would definitely give them a try if you like fried chicken.  In terms of comparison, I would say it is similar to Popeyes.  So if you like that, then you will love this place."

The chicken tacos were my entree and I would definitely get them again. There were 4 and I didn't need to eat them all, but I did! Honestly, two of us could have shared them and been satisfied, especially if we shared a side dish. Daughter had the burrito. It was giant and she ate half. I ate the other half for dinner the next night. Husband's steak alhambre platter really could have been dinner for three people. That entree is a great choice if you like things on the hot side, spice-wise.\n\nThe guacamole is excellent and it also leans to hot. There were two other salsas that came with the chips (I think) and they were great accompaniments. Again, fans of hot will be very pleased.\n\nWe really look forward to our next takeout!

I thought the tacos were tiny for the price. They do package the food perfectly for to go orders. Biggest regret was paying for these tacos. Would have paid $1.50 for tacos like this anywhere else.

Of course the brisket is the most important item on their menu but they also have pork ribs, jalape\u00f1o cheddar sausage and Texas hot links. As for sides, all they serve is mac & cheese and brisket & beans. \n\nWe ordered half a slab of ribs and half a pound of brisket, both were served with sliced Wonder bread, pickles and pickled onions. This detail regarding the accompaniments was not mentioned anywhere on the menu so we ended up ordering extra bread, onions and pickles. What we ordered was plenty of food for two people. \n\nThe ribs were really good, large and tender. The combination of the rub they use along with the tangy guava glaze worked really well. The brisket was also good (I don't know much about brisket, I prefer pulled pork) but my husband on the other hand absolutely loved it, said it's one of the best he's had. I really enjoyed their tangy BBQ sauce. The pickled onions were bland, missing flavor and vinegar. \n\nThere was also a very nice, friendly man inside (I forgot his name) handing out samples of dips, roasted corn salad, mascarpone dessert which he makes himself and sells them at this location (you'll find the items in the fridge by the entrance, not on the restaurant's menu). Everything we tasted was so delicious but I especially loved the smoked mullet dip and the roasted corn salad."

Let's start with the brisket ,  it's so juicy and flavorful it has just the right amount of seasoning , so it doesn't need sauce. I always opt for moist and this was a hit for sure . You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't get this while visiting. I was also given some sausages so kudos to whoever did that because they were delicious :) \nThe potato wedges come with a mustard that's soo good it's not your average mustard and could go well with anything. I was fortunate enough to sit next to a kind man by the name of Carlos who shared some of pork chicharrones and those are next level!! Best I've had , they taste like bacon . The chef Danny came out to greet the customers and ask them how their experience was which was awesome. You can really tell Danny puts his passion into his food and cares for the customers experience . This is a must try in Tampa , the service and food are top notch . GO NOW!!!!"

Let's start with the brisket because I know everyone is wondering how it is. It's good..... like really good and easily the best I've had in Tampa, scratch that Florida . It's smoky , juicy and oh so flavorful , no sauce needed !! The potato wedges are top notch as well , they come with a mustard sauce that just works , the sauce is not your typical mustard and it was enough for me to enjoy the wedges a lot , I probably should mix the bbq sauce with it though because I can only imagine the flavor explosion I'd get from that. The turkey was so tender/juicy like the brisket with a smokiness and faint sweetness. Best turkey I've had bar none it's bananas . The jalape\u00f1o cheddar sausage is just what you'd expect and more , just the right amount of kick and cheddar flavor complementing it makes this some amazing sausage . I think I got a pieces of the hot links with my brisket order the first time but this jalape\u00f1o cheddar is where it's at . Lastly we have their coleslaw , it's hearty and so balanced . Danny doesn't miss at all , everything he makes is with love and you can taste it . Shout out to Sonia and Danny for making every experience so pleasant .

We are so glad we stopped in! \n\nWe split a No Bull Shit sandwich and it was truly no bullshit! The baguette was the perfect choice to hold in all the goodness of the Texas link and brisket slices. What sets this bbq sandwich apart is that it is not covered in sauce, drowning out the flavors of the meats - sauce is served on the side. The sausage had a nice snappy casing, the brisket was tender with excellent smoke flavour. BTW, this sandwich was only $12. I would have priced it at  around $16.95 or so. I'd happily pay over 30% more for it. \n\nWe also had a chance to try the Mac and cheese and it's pretty good. Nice crust. A good Mac and cheese, in my opinion, needs a nice crust. Too many other places are no-crust slop. We also ordered the potato wedges. Usually, wedges aren't my thing, but they looked so good in pics online. They were amazing. Served alongside a house made garlic aioli. Side note: if you taste the aioli on it's own, you will notice how good it is and will want to put it on everything.\n\nCan't wait to go back and try other items. Super nice owner.

I admit I was initially skeptical when my husband suggested we have breakfast here this morning. Barbecue at 9am?! My husband seemed really excited about his new discovery so I decided to give it a chance. \n\nUpon arrival I only saw the \"Grill and Provisions\" sign and the grills for sale on the porch and thought my husband might have been mistaken about breakfast being served. We were quickly greeted by multiple friendly faces and confirmed that breakfast was indeed available. Orders are placed at the cash register and seating is available on the picnic tables outside. After making our selections we were informed that the full menu was not available until 10:30 and that the breakfast sandwich and beverages were are only option. This was fine, but I thought it was a little funny that we were offered a menu if there was only only item available at 9am.\n\nLuckily, \"The Southerner\" or brisket on a biscuit is absolutely delicious! The brisket is melt-in-your-mouth tender, the thick cut bacon is perfectly crispy and the biscuits are buttery good. Even the side of breakfast potatoes, onions and peppers were perfectly seasoned and grilled. I really liked that Spanish Cava was used in the mimosa instead of cheap champagne and the fresh squeezed orange juice was an unexpected surprise.\n\nEverything was so fresh and delicious and served quickly. The casual outdoor seating was perfect for our energetic toddlers. I was really touched that they noticed our three year old wasn't touching the food and they brought him out a quesadilla to eat instead. It's never easy dining with kids, but everyone really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. \n\nWe can't wait to return so we can try the lunch menu!"

Is there any chance you know how to cut the bread the old way?\nWorker: Sure, Getting a meatball? (Starts Cutting Bread)\nMe: Yeah, That's funny.\nCustomer Behind Me In Line: It just works so good because the meatballs don't fall out.\nMe: (To the Customer) Yeah, ever since I worked here like 12yrs ago that's the only way I can eat them.\nWorker: (Frustrated) Sorry, I just can't do it. It won't work. (tosses mangled bread into the trash.\nMe: Ok, Cancel that sandwich then.\nWorker: The Meatball?\nMe: Yeah, It's the only way I'll eat them.\nWorker: What do want on the others?\n*order continues and I move down the counter\nCustomer: Yeah I quit ordering them that way cause no one knows how to do it anymore.\nMe: I order it that way every time, usually they're pretty cool about it. 9 out of 10 times I order it, they do it for me. Though one time the manager of a subway was having a bad day I guess because when I asked for it cut the old way she threw a napkin over the sneeze-quard at me and said \"We don't do it that way anymore and if you don't like it call the 800 number.\" So I did and ended up with free subway for like a month.\n*chuckles and life goes on.\n\nI try not to get mad a the little things in life but upon looking at the name tag of the worker I couldn't get past the fact that under her name it said AREA MANAGER.\n\nWhen I got home I let it bother me enough to call the 800 number and let them know what just happened and that they should look into the situation. After telling the story, the woman on the phone was extremely nice and apologetic about the whole thing and said I'd receive a call in 1 to 2 business days. I said thank you and hung up.\n\nToday that phone call happened.\n\nMe: Hello\nJim Shepard: Hello, this is Jim the owner of subway. I understand you had an incident at my store yesterday?\nMe: Yeah, well, not really an incident, just a situation I thought you should know about.\nJim: Well, what happened?\nMe: Told the story just as above.\nJim: Well, that's not the way I heard it.\nMe: What do you mean?\nJim: She told me that you were bothering other people in line bragging about calling the 800 number and getting free Subway.\nMe: That's not at all what happened. I did talk to the woman behind when she started talking to me about how she likes it cut that way for the meatball.\nJim: Well, I think that you just shouldn't come back into the store again.\nMe: Wait, what? Are you serious?\nJim: Yeah, you seem like a business man. I'm a business man and would you want someone coming into your place disturbing other customers.\nMe: I wasn't disturbing anyone, I was just talking to someone.\nJim: Well, That's not what it looked like on camera, we record everything. I own most of the subways in the area so you should just find somewhere else to eat.\nMe: You're serious? You just said you were a business man and your telling me not to go to any of your subways.\nJim: Yes, we don't need people like you in our stores. Don't Come Back, We'll Get Along Just Fine Without You. We've got plenty of customers we'll survive.\nMe: So you're really serious right now?\nJim: Yeah\nMe: Wow, you're kind of an asshole.\nJim: (Laughs) Coming from someone like you, I take that as a compliment. (Hangs Up)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS: Not once did I ask for anything out of this situation. I simply thought they should know that their Area Manager allowed a customer to just cancel a sandwich with no effort to make it better, and now I'm banned for trying to help."

My \"buffalo chicken\" sub had NO buffalo sauce on it.  I ordered two of these - and both were made the same way. No trace of buffalo sauce anywhere on the sandwich, and the chicken itself was cold - even though they microwaved it.\n\nOverpriced, and the staff just don't seem to take any pride in their work.  Next time I'm in the mood for a sandwich, I'll just go to the SuperValu store next door and get something from their Deli.  It will cost less, take way less time in line, and be less disappointing."

If you eat with your hands, you end up dipping your hands into a pile of gunk on your way to a chip.\n\nFajita Taco - no onions or cilantro and the tortillas were pretty bad. They tasted like they had been frozen, maybe. Or maybe they were just stale. The meat was OK.\n\nQuesadilla - this was actually not good. It's so hard to mess up a quesadilla! How in the world did you mess this one up?? First off, I know you're trying to be super Mexican, but don't use Oaxaca cheese. What you're making is not a Mexican dish, it's a TexMex dish, so use Monterey Jack! If you insist on using Oaxaca cheese, don't leave it all gunky like you did, make sure its fully melted before you serve it (yours was half melted) and use much less. Also, don't put lettuce into a quesadilla. You know that when you cook lettuce, it gets hot? And, that hot lettuce is gross? Also, sour cream doesn't belong in a quesadilla. Leave it as an optional garnish.\n\nLast, how can you not include salsa in a to go order for tacos?? That's a cardinal sin!"

I expected it to be along the lines of my favorite Alice Springs Chicken from Outback. I expect the chicken to be a little salty due to the bacon, but this was too much and the fries were inedible due to the excess of salt and pepper. I thought maybe this was a one off and whomever prepared it messed it up. So I was willing to try it again. \n\nOn my second visit the guy who took my order was very nice. I ordered the same meal as before, they forgot my sauces and I had to go back to ask for them, no big deal. I watched them make my food because you have a clear view into the kitchen. I watched the guy take my already cooked chicken and place it into a broiler. I know that they have to move fast, but I'm willing to wait a little to get fresh chicken cooked. I kept thinking the chicken was undercooked because of the texture, but it did not appear to be. This time the chicken was rubbery, it was tough, just a horrible texture that I threw it away. Overly salted/seasoned again. I have never experienced chicken like that; not edible. \n\nI also wish they would offer another vegetable option like broccoli with the option of cheese and sauces that are not so tangy or spicy, like a regular honey mustard. I say that because it does look like it would be a great option for those looking for a place with healthier options located in the food courts for their kids and since keto and other diets are popular. Also, a great place to take kids, but my 3 year niece just needed regular honey mustard, not a spicy honey mustard. I was told that they only had spicy dipping sauces by the guy who took my order.

Sounded flavorfull and I added a salad for $1. 99.\n\nThe Sandwhich was very good and had a great combination of flavors in the bites that had aioli or bacon jam or jalape\u00f1os on it. I would have given this 4 stars if there would have been more than  a couple of pieces of  jalape\u00f1os and a bit more bacon jam. The chicken breast was very thin too , but the bites I had with a bit of everything satisfied my taste buds.\n\nDon't add the salad, the price isn't worth a palm sized amount of greens and paper thin, kinda slimy cucumbers with 3 cherry tomato halves and a couple red onion chunks.\n\nGlad I tried it once."

My guest and I arrived shortly before noon on Thursday. I was going to come last weekend but we phoned on Saturday at around 10:00am and were told that they were full and had a 25 minute waiting list  Today the restaurant was busy but there were still lots of tables available. I read a review that said the tables were very close together. In my opinion only the tables next to the window were really close together, but the rest were similar to what would find anywhere else. After checking our Covid-19 vaccine passports we were seated immediately by a very friendly hostess. The coffee came quickly right after we were seated. There is a whole separate menu for special coffees in case you prefer something else. Our brunch selections were easy to make and that was probably helped by the fact that most meals were nearly the same price. Most breakfasts were $16.00 give or take 75 cents in 2021. I ordered the Spanish Chorizo Bowl and my guest chose the Apple Pie French Toast. My dish was delicious although it seemed more like a lunch than a breakfast. My guest, who has a real sweet tooth, said that she enjoyed her Apple Pie French Toast. I can't really think of any negatives; it was a fun and filling experience.  I'll definitely come back as I want to try the chicken waffle dish. This caf\u00e9 easily gets five stars. I recommend it for breakfast or lunch."

This traditional Hawaiian dish consists of a burger patty, mushrooms, rice, gravy and eggs. I HAD to try this. I'm not aware of any other restaurant in Edmonton that serves this dish. \n\nUnfortunately, the Loco Moco dish didn't compare to what I had in Hawaii. I felt like the beef wasn't fatty enough if that makes sense. It tasted lean which took away some of the rich flavour which I felt was kind of missing. It didn't taste bad but it tasted healthy (which is what I always say when I eat lean vs regular beef). The dish portion wasn't too big. I probably could've eaten it myself but my husband helped me finish it.\n\nMy husband ordered the Little Farmer breakfast (meant for kids) which had a farmed fresh egg, house cured bacon, toast and hash. The house cured bacon was sweet and tasty. Definitely not your typical breakfast bacon. Loved that!\n\nWe ordered an appetizer portion of mini Belgian waffles with salted caramel sauce for a topping. My husband and I love making Belgian waffles at home. He noticed that they were using the same type of waffle iron we had at home! We're fancy like that hehe. The salted caramel sauce was sweet and salty. I liked it!\n\nThere are more menu items that I would be curious to come back and try. They have a Spam Island Bowl which was also giving me more Hawaiian vibes. I also saw some Filipino dishes that I am familiar with such as pork belly adobo in the Bro's Breakfast and longanisa sausage.\n\nIt's refreshing to see a restaurant be adventurous and try new flavours not usually seen in your typical breakfast places in Edmonton. I'm all for exposing people to different cultures through food. It's the easiest way to try something new without having to hop on a plane."

I see so many people say they don't want their receipt (so the cashier simply throws it away) or I see customers simply throw it away on their way out.

First off, our waiter doesn't even introduce himself, he's a young kid at that maybe 16 years old, and says, \"what do you want to drink?\" Now, I have never been a waitress but I am in customer service and know how to talk to people. A simple how's your day going, what can I start you off with for drinks this morning, would've sufficed. Utensils were dirty, had to ask for a new set, and had to ask someone else for water because my waiter was nowhere to be found and the food was very bland. Overall, this is just another basic NJ diner that is pretty bad, would not recommend."

Our food was delivered very promptly. The $9.99 special menu is awesome! I ordered the prime rib off that and it was better than at other places where I paid twice as much. Our party also had the broiled stuffed flounder and that was great too. Congratulations Country Town Diner. You are excellent. We will be back!"

It's another somewhat close diner to me.  \n\nAtmosphere: \nThe outside looks like a regular building.  It doesn't look like an exciting, metallic or shiny building but it looks nice with plenty of parking.  \n\nThe inside has plenty of booths and tables with a full length bar.  The diner had an odd smell to it which I couldn't pinpoint.  This is something eventually I hope they take care of. \n\nCoffee: \nThe coffee was brewed extremely hot and the waitress brought a bowl of whipped cream.  It was hot, brewed well, and who can argue with that much whipped cream.  In all, I enjoyed it.  \n\nFood: \nThe Country Town Diner has everything a standard diner has.  Breakfast all day, lunch anytime, plenty of seafood and steak options.  There is very little diner food you can't find.  \n\nI decided to order the Hungry Man breakfast.  It came with eggs, sausage, hashbrowns, bacon, pancakes and pork roll.  The pancakes were light and fluffy and some of the best pancakes I've had.  It's only my second time having pork roll but I enjoyed it.  In all, I enjoyed my meal a lot.  \n\nService: \nOur waitress was friendly and kept our beverages refilled at all times.  Plus our food came out quickly, she was one of the best waitresses I've had.  \n\nWould I come back? \nThe Country Town Diner is a great addition to the area and I would come back.  I do hope whatever the smell is taken care of."
